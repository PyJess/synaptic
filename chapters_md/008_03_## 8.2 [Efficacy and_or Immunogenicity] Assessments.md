The primary efficacy endpoint will be the incidence of objectively confirmed recurrent Venous
Thromboembolism (VTE), which will be a composite endpoint comprising:
- Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- Symptomatic DVT of the upper limb.
- Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (symptomatic or unsuspected).
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include the individual components of the primary efficacy
outcome, symptomatic recurrence of VTE, all-cause death, major cardiovascular events, and all
venous thromboembolic events.

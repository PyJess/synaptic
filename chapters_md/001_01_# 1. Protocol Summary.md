=== TABLE 1 ===
| Objectives <br> Endpoints |  |
| --- | --- |
| Primary |  |
| - To assess the non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcutaneous low <br> molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly <br> diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism <br> (PE) in patients with cancer. <br> - |  |
| Secondary |  |
| - To compare the rates of the composite of major and clinically relevant non- <br> major (CRNM) bleeding, and all bleeding events between the apixaban and <br> dalteparin groups. <br> - To assess the incidence of major bleeding (MB) and clinically relevant non- <br> major bleeding (CRNMB). <br> - To evaluate rates of major bleeding in patient subgroups. <br> - To compare the incidence of the Major Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) <br> endpoint, a composite of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), non-fatal <br> pulmonary embolism (PE), and VTE-related death, between apixaban and <br> dalteparin. <br> - To evaluate the efficacy of apixaban versus dalteparin in patient subgroups <br> defined by cancer type and whether the VTE was incidental versus <br> symptomatic. <br> - To evaluate the individual components of the primary efficacy outcome. <br> - To evaluate symptomatic recurrence of VTE. <br> - To evaluate all-cause death. <br> - To evaluate the composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major <br> bleeding. <br> - To evaluate the composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus all-cause <br> death. <br> - To evaluate the composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding <br> plus all-cause death. <br> - To evaluate any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal, including acute <br> myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. <br> - To evaluate all venous thromboembolic events, including splanchnic vein <br> thrombosis and cerebral vein thrombosis. <br> - To evaluate permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety <br> reasons. <br> - To assess Quality of Life (QoL) according to the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale <br> (ACTS). <br> - |  |

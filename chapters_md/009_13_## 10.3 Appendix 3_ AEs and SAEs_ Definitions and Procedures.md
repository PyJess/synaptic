## 10.3 Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures

## for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
## 10.3.1 Definition of AE
## 10.3.1.1 AE Definition
An AE will be any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study
intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with
the use of study intervention.
## 10.3.1.2 Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE
An unsolicited AE will be an AE that was not solicited using a participant diary and that is
communicated by a participant or their representative.

Solicited AEs will be predefined local and systemic events for which the participant is
specifically questioned.
## 10.3.1.3 Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results or other safety assessments considered clinically
significant by the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition.
New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction or overdose.
Common adverse reactions expected with the study agents will include haemorrhage,
contusion, epistaxis, haematoma, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea. The use of
apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any
tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia.
## 10.3.1.4 Events not Meeting the AE Definition
Abnormal findings associated with the underlying disease, unless more severe than
expected.
The disease being studied or its expected progression, unless more severe than expected.
A medical or surgical procedure itself; the condition leading to the procedure will be the AE.
Hospital admission for social or convenience reasons.
Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing conditions that do not worsen.
## 10.3.2 Definition of SAE
An SAE will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or
more of the criteria listed:
a.
Results in death
b.
Is life threatening
c.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
d.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
e.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.
Is  a  suspected  transmission  of  any  infectious  agent  via  an  authorized  medicinal
product
g.
Other situations:
Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening but
may jeopardize the participant or require intervention to prevent one of the other serious out
‐
comes.

## 10.3.3 Recording and Follow-Up of AE and/or SAE
## 10.3.3.1 AE and SAE Recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, the investigator must review all related documentation and record
all relevant information. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the duration of the study, with a particular
focus on bleeding and clotting events.
## 10.3.3.2 Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will assess the intensity of each AE and SAE as:
-
Mild:
Usually transient, minimal or no treatment required, does not interfere with daily activit
‐
ies.
-
Moderate:
Alleviated with specific intervention, interferes with daily activities.
-
Severe:
Interrupts daily activities, significantly affects clinical status, or requires intensive inter
‐
vention.
## 10.3.3.3 Assessment of Causality
The investigator must assess the relationship between the study intervention and each AE/
SAE, considering alternative causes and the temporal relationship. A
reasonable possibility
of a relationship will suggest a causal link. The investigator will consult the IB and/or product
information. This assessment will be crucial for regulatory reporting.
## 10.3.3.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
The investigator will be obligated to perform supplemental evaluations as medically
indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. If a participant dies, a
copy of any postmortem findings will be provided to the sponsor. New or updated
information will be recorded, and any updated SAE data will be submitted to the sponsor
within 24 hours of receipt.
## 10.3.4 Reporting of SAEs
## 10.3.4.1 SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the sponsor will be the electronic data
collection tool. If the electronic system is unavailable, the site will use the paper SAE data
collection tool to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the
electronic system as soon as it becomes available.

## 10.3.4.2 SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via Paper Data Collection Tool
In the event the electronic system is unavailable, facsimile transmission of the paper SAE
data collection tool will be the preferred method. Notification by telephone will be acceptable
in rare circumstances but will not replace the need to complete and sign the SAE data
collection tool within the designated reporting timeframes.

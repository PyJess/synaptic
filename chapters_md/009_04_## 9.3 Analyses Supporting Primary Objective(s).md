## 9.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)/Estimand(s)
## 9.3.1.1 Definition of endpoint(s)
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:
The primary efficacy outcome will be the incidence of the first event of the composite of
objectively confirmed recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or VTE-related death occurring
during the study period. This composite endpoint will include:
- Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- Symptomatic DVT of the upper limb.
- Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- VTE-related death.
Primary Safety Endpoint:
The primary safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding, as defined by the Interna
‚Äê
tional Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. A major bleeding event will be
an acute, clinically overt bleeding event associated with one or more of the following:
- A decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (1.2 mmol/L) or more.
- Transfusion of two or more units of packed red blood cells.
- Bleeding that occurs in a critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-
articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal).
- Bleeding that is fatal.
- Bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention.
## 9.3.1.2 Main Analytical Approach
The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority. The primary statistical analysis for the efficacy
endpoint, which is the time to the first event of the composite of recurrent VTE, will be a time-to-
event analysis. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be calculated to assess
non-inferiority. This approach is supported by findings from similar trials in related indications.
## 9.3.1.3 Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary endpoint results
under different assumptions and analytical approaches.
## 9.3.1.4 Supplementary Analyses
Additional supplementary analyses may be performed to further support the primary objectives.

## 10.4 Appendix 4: Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance

## 10.4.1 Definitions
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will be defined as those who are biologically capable
of becoming pregnant.
## 10.4.2 Contraception Guidance
WOCBP must practice a medically accepted, highly effective method of contraception
during the trial and for one month after the last dose of the study drug.
Highly effective methods will include: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)
hormonal contraception, progestogen-only hormonal contraception, intrauterine device
(IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, a
vasectomized partner, or true sexual abstinence.
Pregnancy or breastfeeding will be exclusionary criteria for study participation. There are no
data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women; as a precautionary measure, it is
preferable to avoid its use during pregnancy. It is unknown if apixaban or its metabolites are
excreted in human milk; therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue
breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from the study drug.
Animal studies with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility.

events (Major Bleeding and CRNMB) according to the primary cancer site. This analysis will
include patients with the following cancer types: Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, Lung, Breast,
Gynecological, and Hematological cancer. This analysis will assess whether the incidence of
bleeding is higher in certain cancer types, such as gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU)
cancer. A further sub-analysis will assess if rates of recurrent VTE vary by cancer type.

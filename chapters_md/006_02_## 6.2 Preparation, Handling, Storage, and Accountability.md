## 6.2 Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability

Apixaban will not require any special storage conditions. Dalteparin should be stored below
30Â°C and must not be frozen. It will be compatible with isotonic sodium chloride (9 mg/ml) or
isotonic glucose (50 mg/ml) infusion solutions in both glass bottles and plastic containers.
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Apixaban tablets may be crushed and
suspended in water, 5% glucose in water (G5W), or apple juice, or mixed with apple puree and
immediately administered orally. Crushed Apixaban tablets will be stable in these media for up to
4 hours. Alternatively, Apixaban tablets may be crushed, suspended in 60 mL of water or G5W,
and immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube.
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions will be
provided in the study reference manual.

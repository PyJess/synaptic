## 2.1 Study Rationale

The trial will be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of
care (SOC), dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH), for the treatment of acute
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The study will evaluate apixaban for
non-inferiority to dalteparin for the primary outcome of recurrent VTE. The rationale for this study
is based on the hypothesis that apixaban will demonstrate a favorable balance between desir
‚Äê
able and undesirable effects for the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer, in the context of
current evidence and cost-effectiveness considerations.

## 8.6 Pharmacodynamics

While standard clotting tests will be affected as expected by the drugâ€™s mechanism of action,
these changes will not be recommended for assessing its pharmacodynamic effects. Apixaban
prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin
time (aPTT), but these are subject to a high degree of variability and will not be recommended
for routine assessment of the pharmacodynamic effect. The thrombin generation assay may be
used to measure the reduction in endogenous thrombin potential.

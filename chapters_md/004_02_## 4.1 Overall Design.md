## 4.1 Overall Design

This will be an international, multicenter, Phase IIIB/Phase 3, pivotal, interventional clinical study
involving approximately 1,170 patients. The study will employ a Prospective Randomized Open
Blinded End-point (PROBE) design, where patients and investigators will be aware of treatment
assignments, but outcome adjudication will be performed in a blinded manner. It will be charac
‚Äê
terized as a pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority, active-controlled, event-driven, randomized
controlled trial.
The study will consist of a 6-month treatment period and will include both randomised and
preference cohorts. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or a low-
molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), dalteparin. The LMWH arm will include the potential for a
transition to warfarin. The treatment duration for both arms will be 6 months.

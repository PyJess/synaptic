# 2. Introduction

Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa.
Its antithrombotic activity does not require antithrombin III. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound
factor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation,
but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. Through the inhibition of factor
Xa, apixaban prevents thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus development. This study
will compare apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), with dalteparin, a low-molecular-
weight heparin (LMWH), for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism in patients with
cancer. The risk of bleeding associated with DOACs appears to vary with cancer type and the
type of DOAC; a threefold to fourfold higher risk is reported for patients with GI cancers.

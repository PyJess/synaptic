## 9.6 Other Safety Analyses

A comprehensive safety analysis will be performed, comparing rates of bleeding events between
the apixaban and dalteparin arms. The main safety endpoint and potential dose-limiting toxicity
for this trial will be major bleeding. Safety endpoints monitored throughout the study will include
major bleeding, the composite of major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and
all bleeding events. Common adverse reactions expected will include anaemia, thrombocyt
‚Äê
openia, haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, haematoma, and nausea.
Context from previous studies, such as the AMPLIFY VTE treatment study, will inform the safety
assessment. In that study, major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of apixaban patients versus 1.8% of
enoxaparin/warfarin patients, and the composite of major and CRNM bleeding occurred in 4.3%
versus 9.7%, respectively.

## 9.9 Sample Size Determination

A total of approximately 1,155 to 1,170 patients will be enrolled in the study. The randomised
cohort is planned to include approximately 671 patients. The sample size calculation will be
based on the primary efficacy estimand and will provide sufficient statistical power to test the
primary hypothesis at a prespecified type-1 error level, using a normal approximation method for
a 2-sided test. Assumptions for the calculation, including those related to intercurrent events and
expected event rates informed by previous large-scale trials, will be detailed.
For context, similar large-scale trials such as the AMPLIFY study randomized 5,395 patients.

## 9.1 General Considerations

## 9.1.1 Decision Criteria/Statistical Hypotheses
The primary objective will be to assess the non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcu
‐
taneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed
proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer
[7, 8]. The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority, and the primary outcome analysis will
be based on time-to-event data. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be cal
‐
culated.
The null and alternative hypotheses will be formulated to support this non-inferiority objective.
Nominal significance levels, confidence interval probabilities, and the use of 1- or 2-sided tests
will be prespecified.
Previous studies provide context for this non-inferiority framework. For example, the AMPLIFY
study for VTE treatment showed apixaban to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin (p < 0.0001).
This study will be designed to test for a similar non-inferiority outcome in the specified cancer
patient population.
Hypotheses for secondary objectives will also be defined, potentially including both non-inferior
‐
ity  and  superiority  testing  frameworks.  The  rationale  for  the  non-inferiority  margin  and  its
operational evaluation will be detailed.
## 9.1.2 Multiplicity Adjustment
To control the overall type I error in the trial, a closed testing procedure will be implemented to
manage the family-wise error rate [9, 10]. Key secondary endpoints, such as major bleeding and
all-cause death, may be tested using a pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy. This fixed
sequence testing procedure will ensure that subsequent hypotheses are tested only if the
preceding  ones  are  statistically  significant  at  their  prespecified  levels.  The  step-by-step
hierarchical testing procedures and strategies for Type I error control will be fully defined.
## 9.1.3 Impact of Intercurrent Events Strategies
Strategies for handling intercurrent events will be defined for the analysis to ensure a robust
interpretation of the results.
## 9.1.4 Handling of Missing Data
Procedures and statistical methods for managing and imputing missing data will be prespecified
to minimize bias in the analyses.

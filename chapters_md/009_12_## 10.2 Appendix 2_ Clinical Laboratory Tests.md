## 10.2 Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests

The tests detailed in the table below will be performed by a central or local laboratory as
specified. Local laboratory results may be used if central results are not available in a timely
manner for study intervention or response evaluation. Additional tests may be performed as
determined necessary by the investigator.

NOTES:
Exclusion Criteria:
Hemoglobin level < 8 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L) or a platelet count < 75x10⁹/L.
Creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault). Apixaban use will be cautioned in
patients with creatinine clearance of 15-29 mL/min and not recommended for those with
clearance < 15 mL/min or on dialysis.
Liver Safety:
Liver function testing will be performed prior to initiating apixaban.
Patients will be excluded if Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is ≥3 times the upper limit
of normal (ULN) and/or a bilirubin level is ≥2 times the ULN.
Apixaban will be contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with
coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk.
Coagulation Tests:
Clotting tests (e.g., PT, INR, aPTT) will be affected by apixaban, but changes are variable.
Routine monitoring will not be required, but a calibrated quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay
may be useful in exceptional situations like overdose or emergency surgery.
In studies with dalteparin in patients with end-stage renal failure, no evidence of
bioaccumulation of anti-Factor Xa serum levels was observed.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.

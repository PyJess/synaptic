## 3.2 Estimands for Secondary Objective(s)

Secondary estimand(s) for Secondary Objective
-
Secondary Safety Outcomes:
Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding (CRNMB); Composite
of major bleeding and CRNMB; Permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety
reasons.
-
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes:
The individual components of the primary efficacy outcome;
Symptomatic recurrence of VTE; All-cause death; The composite of the primary efficacy out
‐
come plus major bleeding; Any major cardiovascular event; All venous thromboembolic events.

-
Time-to-Event Measurements:
The primary outcome of recurrent VTE will be assessed over
the 6-month trial period.
-
Quality of Life (QoL):
QoL will be assessed according to the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale
(ACTS).
-
Subgroup Analyses:
Analyses will be conducted on patient subgroups defined by cancer
type, cancer treatment, and whether the initial VTE was incidental versus symptomatic. These
analyses will explore if patients with incidental VTE have a different risk profile for recurrence
and major bleeding compared to patients with symptomatic VTE.

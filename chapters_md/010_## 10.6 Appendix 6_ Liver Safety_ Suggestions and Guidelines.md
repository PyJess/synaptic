## 10.6 Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggestions and Guidelines

## for Liver Events
Patients will be excluded from the study if they have acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis,
or liver cirrhosis.
Patients will also be excluded if their alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is ≥3 times the
upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or their bilirubin level is ≥2 times the ULN.
Apixaban will be contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with
coagulopathy and a clinically relevant bleeding risk. It will not be recommended for patients
with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution in those with mild or
moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or B).
Liver function testing will be performed prior to initiating apixaban.
# 10.7 Appendix 7: Medical Device AEs, ADEs, SAEs,
# SADEs, USADEs and Device Deficiencies: Definitions
# and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up,
# and Reporting in Medical Device Studies
The definitions and procedures detailed in this appendix will be in accordance with ISO
14155 and the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 for clinical device
research (if applicable).
## 10.7.1 Definition of Medical Device AE and ADE
A medical device AE will be any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant,
user, or other person, temporally associated with the use of a study device.
An adverse device effect (ADE) will be an AE related to the use of an investigational
medical device, including events from use error or malfunction.
## 10.7.2 Definition of Medical Device SAE, SADE and USADE
A Medical Device SAE will be an AE that led to death, serious deterioration in health (life-
threatening illness, permanent impairment, hospitalization), or fetal distress/death/
congenital abnormality.
An SADE will be an ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of an
SAE, or a device deficiency that might have led to an SAE.

•
•
•
•
•
•
An USADE will be an SADE that, by its nature, incidence, severity, or outcome, has not
been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.
## 10.7.3 Definition of Device Deficiency
A device deficiency will be an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity,
quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. This will include malfunctions, use
errors, and inadequate information from the manufacturer.
## 10.7.4 Recording and Follow-Up of Medical Device AE and/or
## SAE and Device Deficiencies
## 10.7.4.1 Medical Device AE, SAE, and Device Deficiency Recording
The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE/device deficiency information in the
participant’s medical records and on the appropriate form. For device deficiencies, any
corrective or remedial actions taken must be described.
## 10.7.4.2 Assessment of Intensity
Intensity will be assessed as Mild, Moderate, or Severe.
## 10.7.4.3 Assessment of Causality
The investigator will assess the relationship between the study device and each event,
using clinical judgment and consulting the investigator’s brochure or instructions for use.
## 10.7.4.4 Follow-up of Medical Device AE/SAE and device deficiency
The investigator will perform supplemental evaluations as needed to elucidate the nature
and causality of the event. Updated information will be recorded and submitted to the
sponsor promptly.
## 10.7.5 Reporting of Medical Device SAEs
SAEs will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours, primarily via an electronic data
collection tool, with a paper-based system as a backup.

•
•
## 10.7.6 Reporting of SADEs
Any device deficiency associated with an SAE must be reported to the sponsor within 24
hours. The sponsor will review these events and report them to regulatory authorities and
IRBs/IECs as required.
# 10.8 Appendix 8: Country-specific Requirements
This appendix will detail any country-specific requirements or regional regulatory adaptations
that cannot be addressed by flexible language within the main body of the protocol.
# 10.9 Appendix 9: Protocol Amendment History
The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment will be located
before the table of contents. This appendix will contain the history of all previous amendments.
Amendments will be classified as substantial or non-substantial based on criteria set forth in
regulations such as EU No 536/2014. The rationale for changes will be documented, and a clear
numbering system for global, country-specific, and site-specific amendments will be maintained.

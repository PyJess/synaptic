## 3.1 Estimand(s) for Primary Objective(s)

Population:
Patients with cancer and symptomatic or incidentally diagnosed acute proximal
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients with basal cell or
squamous cell skin cancers, primary or metastatic cerebral cancers, known brain
metastases, and acute leukaemia will be excluded. Careful consideration will be required for
patients with GI malignancies due to a higher risk of bleeding and for patients with severe
renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) for whom DOACs are generally not
recommended [1, 2].
Variable (or Endpoint):
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the time to first event of the
composite of recurrent VTE over 6 months. The primary safety endpoint will be the
incidence of major bleeding over 6 months.
Treatment Condition:
Apixaban versus dalteparin over a 6-month treatment period.
Intercurrent Events:
Not specified.
Population-Level Summary:
The primary outcome analysis will be based on time-to-event
data, for which a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be calculated.
Rationale:
The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority. The non-inferiority design is
based on the hypothesis that apixaban will provide a favorable balance between benefits
and harms.

## 6.8 Treatment of Overdose

For this study, any dose of apixaban that results in a higher risk of bleeding may be considered
an overdose.
In the event of an overdose or haemorrhagic complications, the investigator should:
- Discontinue treatment and investigate the source of bleeding.
- Consider the initiation of appropriate treatment, such as surgical haemostasis, transfusion of
fresh frozen plasma, or administration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors.
- A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) is available for adults. Administration of prothrombin
complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may also be considered [3, 4].
- Administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban overdose or
accidental ingestion.
- Haemodialysis is unlikely to be an effective means of managing apixaban overdose.

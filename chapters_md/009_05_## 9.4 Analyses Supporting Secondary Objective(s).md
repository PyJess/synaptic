## 9.4.1 Analyses Supporting Secondary Objective [label]
Statistical analyses will be performed for all secondary endpoints.
Secondary Safety Outcomes:
-
Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding (CRNMB):
An acute, clinically overt bleeding event
not meeting major bleeding criteria but requiring medical intervention, an unscheduled physician
contact, temporary cessation of the study drug, or associated with pain or impairment of daily
activities. Specific examples will include spontaneous large hematomas, significant epistaxis,
macroscopic hematuria, or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring endoscopy.
-
Composite Safety Outcomes:
- The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB.
- Permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety reasons.
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes:
- The individual components of the primary efficacy outcome.
- Symptomatic recurrence of VTE.
- All-cause death.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus all-cause death.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding plus all-cause death.
- Any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal (including acute myocardial infarction or
ischemic stroke).
- All venous thromboembolic events (including splanchnic and cerebral vein thrombosis).
- Major VTE endpoint (composite of proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and VTE-related death).
Quality of Life (QoL):
- QoL will be assessed using the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS).
Subgroup Analyses:
- Analyses will be conducted on patient subgroups defined by cancer type, cancer treatment,
and whether the initial VTE was incidental versus symptomatic.

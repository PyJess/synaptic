## 6.6 Dose Modification

Apixaban:
No dose adjustment will be necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal
impairment. Apixaban will be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. For
patients with cancer and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), a VKA
is generally preferred over LMWH and DOACs.
Dalteparin:
Dose modifications will be permitted according to the product label and
investigator discretion, based on factors such as patient weight, renal function, and clinical
events (bleeding or thrombosis). The dose can be adjusted by increments/decrements of
500 IU or 1,000 IU. Criteria for dose adjustments will include the occurrence of minor
bleeding, prolonged access compression time (>10 minutes), or other clinical events.

## 8.1 Administrative [and General/Baseline] Procedures

At screening, baseline characteristics will be recorded, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
diabetes,  and  coronary  artery  disease.  Based  on  historical  data  from  similar  trials  (e.g.,
ADVANCE-3), the expected prevalence of these comorbidities is approximately 46% for hyper
‚Äê
tension, 10% for hyperlipidemia, 9% for diabetes, and 8% for coronary artery disease.
For context, this trial will exclude patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary
brain tumors, known brain metastases, or acute leukemia.

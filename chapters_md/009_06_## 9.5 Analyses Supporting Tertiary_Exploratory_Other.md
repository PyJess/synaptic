## 9.5 Analyses Supporting Tertiary/Exploratory/Other

## Objective(s)
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to further investigate treatment effects. A sub-analysis
will assess the incidence of bleeding events (Major Bleeding and CRNMB) according to cancer
site, including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, lung, breast, gynaecological, and haematological
cancers. This analysis will explore whether the incidence of bleeding is highest in patients with
certain cancer types, such as gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancer, particularly if the cancer
is not resected. It will also assess if rates of recurrent VTE are highest in specific cancer sub
‚Äê
groups.
Additionally, analyses will be conducted combining patients across treatment arms to identify
patient characteristics associated with a higher overall risk of VTE recurrence or major bleeding,
recognizing that patients with active cancer are at high risk for both.

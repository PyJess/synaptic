## 8.4 Adverse Events (AEs) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs),

## and Other Safety Reporting
The definitions of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) can be found in
Appendix 3. Adverse events will be monitored with a particular focus on bleeding and clotting
events. Common adverse reactions expected will include haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis,
and haematoma. The use of apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or
overt bleeding from any tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The
investigator and any qualified designees will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
## 8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE
## Information
All SAEs and AEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the
final follow-up visit at 7 months. The primary monitoring period will cover the 6-month treatment
period. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining
informed consent will be recorded as medical history, not as AEs. All SAEs will be recorded and
reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed
24 hours.
## 8.4.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non
‐
leading verbal questioning of the participant will be the preferred method to inquire about AE
occurrences. Patients receiving apixaban will be carefully observed for any signs of bleeding.
Specific signs and symptoms of bleeding to monitor for will include bruising or bleeding under
the skin, tar-coloured stools, blood in urine, epistaxis, dizziness, tiredness, paleness, weakness,
sudden severe headache, and coughing up or vomiting blood.
## 8.4.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After  the  initial  AE/SAE  report,  the  investigator  will  be  required  to  proactively  follow  each
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and AEs of special interest (as defined in
Section 8.4.8) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or
the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3).
## 8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE will be essential so that
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants are met.
The sponsor will have a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical
investigation.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE will review and
then file it and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse
reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and
forwarded to investigators within 15 days.
## 8.4.5 Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in participants able to give birth will be collected after the start of
study intervention and until the time period for post-intervention contraception has passed.
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the
appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.
While pregnancy itself will not be considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE.
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered SAEs and will be reported as such.
The investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant, the pregnancy outcome,
and the neonate.
## 8.4.6 Cardiovascular and Death Events
Assessment of any major cardiovascular event (fatal or non-fatal, including acute myocardial
infarction or ischemic stroke) and all-cause death will be secondary objectives of this study.

## 8.4.7 Disease-related Events and/or Disease-related Outcomes Not
## Qualifying as AEs or SAEs
Certain disease-related events (DREs) that are common in participants with the disease under
study may not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs,
even if they meet the SAE definition. However, if the event is of greater intensity, frequency, or
duration than expected for the individual, or if the investigator considers there is a reasonable
possibility that the event was related to the study intervention, it must be reported as an AE/SAE.
## 8.4.8 Adverse Events of Special Interest
The primary safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding, as defined by the Interna
‐
tional  Society  on  Thrombosis  and  Haemostasis  (ISTH)  guidelines.  All  bleeding  criteria  will
include surgical site bleeding.
Major Bleeding:
An event will be characterized as acute, clinically overt bleeding
associated with one or more of the following criteria:
A decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (1.2 mmol/L) or more.
The transfusion of two or more units of packed red blood cells.
Bleeding that occurs in at least one critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular,
pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or
retroperitoneal).
Bleeding that is fatal.
Bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention.
Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding (CRNMB):
An acute, clinically overt bleeding
event that does not meet the criteria for major bleeding and consists of one of the following:
Any bleeding that compromises hemodynamics.
Spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm², or 100 cm² if traumatic.
Intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography.
Epistaxis or gingival bleeding requiring intervention, or venipuncture bleeding lasting >5
minutes.
Macroscopic hematuria that is spontaneous or lasts >24 hours post-procedure.
Hemoptysis, hematemesis, or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring intervention.
Any other bleeding event considered to have clinical consequences (requiring medical
intervention, unscheduled contact, temporary drug cessation, or associated with pain/
impairment).

This study will assess the incidence of major bleeding and CRNMB in both treatment arms, with
a particular focus on whether the incidence is higher in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) and
genitourinary (GU) cancer.

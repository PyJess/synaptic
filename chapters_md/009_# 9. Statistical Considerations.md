# 9. Statistical Considerations

# 9.1 General Considerations
## 9.1.1 Decision Criteria/Statistical Hypotheses
The primary objective will be to assess the non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcu
‐
taneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed
proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer
[7, 8]. The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority, and the primary outcome analysis will
be based on time-to-event data. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be cal
‐
culated.
The null and alternative hypotheses will be formulated to support this non-inferiority objective.
Nominal significance levels, confidence interval probabilities, and the use of 1- or 2-sided tests
will be prespecified.
Previous studies provide context for this non-inferiority framework. For example, the AMPLIFY
study for VTE treatment showed apixaban to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin (p < 0.0001).
This study will be designed to test for a similar non-inferiority outcome in the specified cancer
patient population.
Hypotheses for secondary objectives will also be defined, potentially including both non-inferior
‐
ity  and  superiority  testing  frameworks.  The  rationale  for  the  non-inferiority  margin  and  its
operational evaluation will be detailed.
## 9.1.2 Multiplicity Adjustment
To control the overall type I error in the trial, a closed testing procedure will be implemented to
manage the family-wise error rate [9, 10]. Key secondary endpoints, such as major bleeding and
all-cause death, may be tested using a pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy. This fixed
sequence testing procedure will ensure that subsequent hypotheses are tested only if the
preceding  ones  are  statistically  significant  at  their  prespecified  levels.  The  step-by-step
hierarchical testing procedures and strategies for Type I error control will be fully defined.
## 9.1.3 Impact of Intercurrent Events Strategies
Strategies for handling intercurrent events will be defined for the analysis to ensure a robust
interpretation of the results.
## 9.1.4 Handling of Missing Data
Procedures and statistical methods for managing and imputing missing data will be prespecified
to minimize bias in the analyses.
# 9.2 Analysis Sets
For the purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets will be defined:
-
Full Analysis Set (FAS):
All randomized participants.
-
Safety Analysis Set (SAS):
All participants who are exposed to the investigational interven
‐
tion.
The study will include both randomised and preference cohorts. The randomized cohort will
include approximately 671 patients with cancer and either symptomatic or incidentally diagnosed
VTE. Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS, with participants analyzed according to
their planned investigational intervention. Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS, with
participants analyzed according to the investigational intervention they actually received.
Specific  exclusion  criteria  will  be  applied  to  the  analysis  cohort.  Patients  with  primary  or
metastatic cerebral cancers and those with acute leukaemia will be excluded. Following the
precedent of similar trials, patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary brain
tumors, or known brain metastases will also be excluded. Furthermore, patients with lesions or
conditions considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding, such as recent brain or spinal
injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, or recent intracranial haemorrhage, will be ex
‐
cluded.
# 9.3 Analyses Supporting Primary Objective(s)
## 9.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)/Estimand(s)
9.3.1.1 Definition of endpoint(s)
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:
The primary efficacy outcome will be the incidence of the first event of the composite of
objectively confirmed recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or VTE-related death occurring
during the study period. This composite endpoint will include:
- Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- Symptomatic DVT of the upper limb.
- Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- VTE-related death.
Primary Safety Endpoint:
The primary safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding, as defined by the Interna
‐
tional Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. A major bleeding event will be
an acute, clinically overt bleeding event associated with one or more of the following:
- A decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (1.2 mmol/L) or more.
- Transfusion of two or more units of packed red blood cells.
- Bleeding that occurs in a critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-
articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal).
- Bleeding that is fatal.
- Bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention.
9.3.1.2 Main Analytical Approach
The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority. The primary statistical analysis for the efficacy
endpoint, which is the time to the first event of the composite of recurrent VTE, will be a time-to-
event analysis. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be calculated to assess
non-inferiority. This approach is supported by findings from similar trials in related indications.
9.3.1.3 Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary endpoint results
under different assumptions and analytical approaches.
9.3.1.4 Supplementary Analyses
Additional supplementary analyses may be performed to further support the primary objectives.
# 9.4 Analyses Supporting Secondary Objective(s)
## 9.4.1 Analyses Supporting Secondary Objective [label]
Statistical analyses will be performed for all secondary endpoints.
Secondary Safety Outcomes:
-
Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding (CRNMB):
An acute, clinically overt bleeding event
not meeting major bleeding criteria but requiring medical intervention, an unscheduled physician
contact, temporary cessation of the study drug, or associated with pain or impairment of daily
activities. Specific examples will include spontaneous large hematomas, significant epistaxis,
macroscopic hematuria, or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring endoscopy.
-
Composite Safety Outcomes:
- The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB.
- Permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety reasons.
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes:
- The individual components of the primary efficacy outcome.
- Symptomatic recurrence of VTE.
- All-cause death.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus all-cause death.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding plus all-cause death.
- Any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal (including acute myocardial infarction or
ischemic stroke).
- All venous thromboembolic events (including splanchnic and cerebral vein thrombosis).
- Major VTE endpoint (composite of proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and VTE-related death).
Quality of Life (QoL):
- QoL will be assessed using the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS).
Subgroup Analyses:
- Analyses will be conducted on patient subgroups defined by cancer type, cancer treatment,
and whether the initial VTE was incidental versus symptomatic.
# 9.5 Analyses Supporting Tertiary/Exploratory/Other
# Objective(s)
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to further investigate treatment effects. A sub-analysis
will assess the incidence of bleeding events (Major Bleeding and CRNMB) according to cancer
site, including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, lung, breast, gynaecological, and haematological
cancers. This analysis will explore whether the incidence of bleeding is highest in patients with
certain cancer types, such as gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancer, particularly if the cancer
is not resected. It will also assess if rates of recurrent VTE are highest in specific cancer sub
‐
groups.
Additionally, analyses will be conducted combining patients across treatment arms to identify
patient characteristics associated with a higher overall risk of VTE recurrence or major bleeding,
recognizing that patients with active cancer are at high risk for both.
# 9.6 Other Safety Analyses
A comprehensive safety analysis will be performed, comparing rates of bleeding events between
the apixaban and dalteparin arms. The main safety endpoint and potential dose-limiting toxicity
for this trial will be major bleeding. Safety endpoints monitored throughout the study will include
major bleeding, the composite of major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and
all bleeding events. Common adverse reactions expected will include anaemia, thrombocyt
‐
openia, haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, haematoma, and nausea.
Context from previous studies, such as the AMPLIFY VTE treatment study, will inform the safety
assessment. In that study, major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of apixaban patients versus 1.8% of
enoxaparin/warfarin patients, and the composite of major and CRNM bleeding occurred in 4.3%
versus 9.7%, respectively.
# 9.7 Other Analyses
## 9.7.1 Other variables and/or parameters
Additional parameters will be analyzed as specified.
## 9.7.2 Subgroup analyses
Predefined subgroup analyses will be conducted to evaluate the consistency of treatment ef
‐
fects. These will include evaluating rates of major bleeding and the efficacy of apixaban versus
dalteparin in patient subgroups defined by cancer type, cancer treatment, and whether the VTE
was incidental versus symptomatic.
These analyses will explore whether safety and efficacy are consistent across subgroups and
will assess if patients with incidental VTE have a different risk profile for recurrence and major
bleeding compared to patients with symptomatic VTE.
Previous large-scale studies have shown the efficacy of apixaban to be generally consistent
across subgroups, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and renal function. This study
will further explore these relationships within the cancer patient population.
# 9.8 Interim Analyses
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to evaluate interim data.
The timing of interim analyses will be based on event-based triggers. The analyses will be
conducted using a group sequential design with an alpha spending approach to maintain the
overall type I error rate. Conditional power calculations may be performed to assess the probab
‐
ility of study success, and the study may be stopped for futility if this power is low. All procedures
will be conducted in a manner that maintains the integrity of the study, with strict blinding
protocols for all personnel involved in the interim analysis.
# 9.9 Sample Size Determination
A total of approximately 1,155 to 1,170 patients will be enrolled in the study. The randomised
cohort is planned to include approximately 671 patients. The sample size calculation will be
based on the primary efficacy estimand and will provide sufficient statistical power to test the
primary hypothesis at a prespecified type-1 error level, using a normal approximation method for
a 2-sided test. Assumptions for the calculation, including those related to intercurrent events and
expected event rates informed by previous large-scale trials, will be detailed.
For context, similar large-scale trials such as the AMPLIFY study randomized 5,395 patients.

NOTES:
Exclusion Criteria:
Hemoglobin level < 8 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L) or a platelet count < 75x10⁹/L.
Creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault). Apixaban use will be cautioned in
patients with creatinine clearance of 15-29 mL/min and not recommended for those with
clearance < 15 mL/min or on dialysis.
Liver Safety:
Liver function testing will be performed prior to initiating apixaban.
Patients will be excluded if Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is ≥3 times the upper limit
of normal (ULN) and/or a bilirubin level is ≥2 times the ULN.
Apixaban will be contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with
coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk.
Coagulation Tests:
Clotting tests (e.g., PT, INR, aPTT) will be affected by apixaban, but changes are variable.
Routine monitoring will not be required, but a calibrated quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay
may be useful in exceptional situations like overdose or emergency surgery.
In studies with dalteparin in patients with end-stage renal failure, no evidence of
bioaccumulation of anti-Factor Xa serum levels was observed.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.
# 10.3 Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures
# for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
## 10.3.1 Definition of AE
10.3.1.1 AE Definition
An AE will be any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study
intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with
the use of study intervention.
10.3.1.2 Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE
An unsolicited AE will be an AE that was not solicited using a participant diary and that is
communicated by a participant or their representative.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Solicited AEs will be predefined local and systemic events for which the participant is
specifically questioned.
10.3.1.3 Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results or other safety assessments considered clinically
significant by the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition.
New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction or overdose.
Common adverse reactions expected with the study agents will include haemorrhage,
contusion, epistaxis, haematoma, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea. The use of
apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any
tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia.
10.3.1.4 Events not Meeting the AE Definition
Abnormal findings associated with the underlying disease, unless more severe than
expected.
The disease being studied or its expected progression, unless more severe than expected.
A medical or surgical procedure itself; the condition leading to the procedure will be the AE.
Hospital admission for social or convenience reasons.
Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing conditions that do not worsen.
## 10.3.2 Definition of SAE
An SAE will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or
more of the criteria listed:
a.
Results in death
b.
Is life threatening
c.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
d.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
e.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.
Is  a  suspected  transmission  of  any  infectious  agent  via  an  authorized  medicinal
product
g.
Other situations:
Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening but
may jeopardize the participant or require intervention to prevent one of the other serious out
‐
comes.

## 10.3.3 Recording and Follow-Up of AE and/or SAE
10.3.3.1 AE and SAE Recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, the investigator must review all related documentation and record
all relevant information. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the duration of the study, with a particular
focus on bleeding and clotting events.
10.3.3.2 Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will assess the intensity of each AE and SAE as:
-
Mild:
Usually transient, minimal or no treatment required, does not interfere with daily activit
‐
ies.
-
Moderate:
Alleviated with specific intervention, interferes with daily activities.
-
Severe:
Interrupts daily activities, significantly affects clinical status, or requires intensive inter
‐
vention.
10.3.3.3 Assessment of Causality
The investigator must assess the relationship between the study intervention and each AE/
SAE, considering alternative causes and the temporal relationship. A
reasonable possibility
of a relationship will suggest a causal link. The investigator will consult the IB and/or product
information. This assessment will be crucial for regulatory reporting.
10.3.3.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
The investigator will be obligated to perform supplemental evaluations as medically
indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. If a participant dies, a
copy of any postmortem findings will be provided to the sponsor. New or updated
information will be recorded, and any updated SAE data will be submitted to the sponsor
within 24 hours of receipt.
## 10.3.4 Reporting of SAEs
10.3.4.1 SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the sponsor will be the electronic data
collection tool. If the electronic system is unavailable, the site will use the paper SAE data
collection tool to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the
electronic system as soon as it becomes available.
•
•
•
•
10.3.4.2 SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via Paper Data Collection Tool
In the event the electronic system is unavailable, facsimile transmission of the paper SAE
data collection tool will be the preferred method. Notification by telephone will be acceptable
in rare circumstances but will not replace the need to complete and sign the SAE data
collection tool within the designated reporting timeframes.
# 10.4 Appendix 4: Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance
## 10.4.1 Definitions
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will be defined as those who are biologically capable
of becoming pregnant.
## 10.4.2 Contraception Guidance
WOCBP must practice a medically accepted, highly effective method of contraception
during the trial and for one month after the last dose of the study drug.
Highly effective methods will include: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)
hormonal contraception, progestogen-only hormonal contraception, intrauterine device
(IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, a
vasectomized partner, or true sexual abstinence.
Pregnancy or breastfeeding will be exclusionary criteria for study participation. There are no
data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women; as a precautionary measure, it is
preferable to avoid its use during pregnancy. It is unknown if apixaban or its metabolites are
excreted in human milk; therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue
breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from the study drug.
Animal studies with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility.
# 10.5 Appendix 5: Genetics
Where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA analysis from
consenting participants. DNA samples will be used for research related to the study intervention,
the indication, and related diseases. This may include pharmacogenomic analysis, candidate
gene analysis, or genome-wide analysis to understand how genetic variation impacts drug re
‐
sponse, disease susceptibility, and progression [11, 12]. Samples will be stored securely to
protect confidentiality and will be retained for a specified period as per local requirements.

# 10.6 Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggestions and Guidelines
# for Liver Events
Patients will be excluded from the study if they have acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis,
or liver cirrhosis.
Patients will also be excluded if their alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is ≥3 times the
upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or their bilirubin level is ≥2 times the ULN.
Apixaban will be contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with
coagulopathy and a clinically relevant bleeding risk. It will not be recommended for patients
with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution in those with mild or
moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or B).
Liver function testing will be performed prior to initiating apixaban.

14155 and the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 for clinical device
research (if applicable).
# 10.7.1 Definition of Medical Device AE and ADE
A medical device AE will be any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant,
user, or other person, temporally associated with the use of a study device.
An adverse device effect (ADE) will be an AE related to the use of an investigational
medical device, including events from use error or malfunction.
# 10.7.2 Definition of Medical Device SAE, SADE and USADE
A Medical Device SAE will be an AE that led to death, serious deterioration in health (life-
threatening illness, permanent impairment, hospitalization), or fetal distress/death/
congenital abnormality.
An SADE will be an ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of an
SAE, or a device deficiency that might have led to an SAE.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
An USADE will be an SADE that, by its nature, incidence, severity, or outcome, has not
been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.
# 10.7.3 Definition of Device Deficiency
A device deficiency will be an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity,
quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. This will include malfunctions, use
errors, and inadequate information from the manufacturer.
# 10.7.4 Recording and Follow-Up of Medical Device AE and/or
# SAE and Device Deficiencies
## 10.7.4.1 Medical Device AE, SAE, and Device Deficiency Recording
The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE/device deficiency information in the
participant’s medical records and on the appropriate form. For device deficiencies, any
corrective or remedial actions taken must be described.
## 10.7.4.2 Assessment of Intensity
Intensity will be assessed as Mild, Moderate, or Severe.
## 10.7.4.3 Assessment of Causality
The investigator will assess the relationship between the study device and each event,
using clinical judgment and consulting the investigator’s brochure or instructions for use.

# 10.7.6 Reporting of SADEs
Any device deficiency associated with an SAE must be reported to the sponsor within 24
hours. The sponsor will review these events and report them to regulatory authorities and
IRBs/IECs as required.
# 10.8 Appendix 8: Country-specific Requirements
This appendix will detail any country-specific requirements or regional regulatory adaptations
that cannot be addressed by flexible language within the main body of the protocol.
# 10.9 Appendix 9: Protocol Amendment History
The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment will be located
before the table of contents. This appendix will contain the history of all previous amendments.
Amendments will be classified as substantial or non-substantial based on criteria set forth in
regulations such as EU No 536/2014. The rationale for changes will be documented, and a clear
numbering system for global, country-specific, and site-specific amendments will be maintained.

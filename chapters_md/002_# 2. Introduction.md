# 2. Introduction

Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa.
Its antithrombotic activity does not require antithrombin III. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound
factor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation,
but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. Through the inhibition of factor
Xa, apixaban prevents thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus development. This study
will compare apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), with dalteparin, a low-molecular-
weight heparin (LMWH), for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism in patients with
cancer. The risk of bleeding associated with DOACs appears to vary with cancer type and the
type of DOAC; a threefold to fourfold higher risk is reported for patients with GI cancers.
# 2.1 Study Rationale
The trial will be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of
care (SOC), dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH), for the treatment of acute
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The study will evaluate apixaban for
non-inferiority to dalteparin for the primary outcome of recurrent VTE. The rationale for this study
is based on the hypothesis that apixaban will demonstrate a favorable balance between desir
‐
able and undesirable effects for the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer, in the context of
current evidence and cost-effectiveness considerations.
# 2.2 Background
The study will enroll patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). Approxim
‐
ately 5% to 20% of patients with cancer develop a VTE, and approximately 20% of all VTE
cases occur in patients with cancer. Patients with active cancer can be at high risk of both
venous thromboembolism and bleeding events. Sites of cancer with the highest rates of VTE
include the pancreas, kidney, ovary, lung, and stomach. When apixaban is considered for DVT
or PE treatment in cancer patients, a careful assessment of the benefits against the risks should
be made. It should be noted that patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary
or metastatic cerebral cancers, known brain metastases, and acute leukaemia will be excluded
from this study.
Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa.
Its antithrombotic activity does not require antithrombin III. Apixaban functions by inhibiting both
free and clot-bound factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity. Through the inhibition of factor
Xa, apixaban prevents thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus development.
Previous clinical trials have evaluated apixaban against dalteparin for the treatment of VTE in
patients with cancer. The direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are
the only DOACs that were evaluated for the short-term treatment of VTE for patients with
cancer, and different DOACs have different drug-drug interactions.
# 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
## 2.3.1 Risk Assessment
The main safety endpoint for this trial will be major bleeding. Common adverse reactions
expected with these agents include haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma. Safety
endpoints will include major bleeding, a composite of major and clinically relevant non-major
(CRNM)  bleeding,  and  all  bleeding  events.  As  with  other  anticoagulants,  patients  taking
apixaban will be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. Caution with direct factor Xa inhibitors
will be warranted in GI and genitourinary malignancies and other settings with high risk for
mucosal bleeding, as a threefold to fourfold higher risk of bleeding is reported for patients with
GI cancers. This study will assess the incidence of bleeding in both treatment groups, including
analyses  by  cancer  localization,  with  a  focus  on  patients  with  gastrointestinal  (GI)  and
genitourinary (GU) cancer.
## 2.3.2 Benefit Assessment
This study will assess whether apixaban is non-inferior to dalteparin for the treatment of cancer-
associated VTE. The primary efficacy outcome will be the incidence of recurrent VTE at 6
months. The study will also evaluate rates of recurrent VTE in subgroups of patients based on
cancer type, such as gynecological cancer, GI cancer, genitourinary cancer, and lung cancer.
## 2.3.3 Overall Benefit Risk Conclusion
This study is designed to test the hypothesis that apixaban has a favorable benefit-risk profile,
demonstrating non-inferiority for VTE recurrence with a similar risk of major bleeding compared
to LMWH (dalteparin). The study aims to provide high-quality evidence to support apixaban as a
treatment option for VTE in patients with cancer. The choice of treatment must be based on the
specific  clinical  setting  to  minimize  risk,  after  careful  consideration  of  potential  drug-drug
interactions, bleeding risk, patient preference, and the availability of treatment options, including
cost considerations.

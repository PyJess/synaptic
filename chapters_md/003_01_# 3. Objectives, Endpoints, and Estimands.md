# 3. Objectives, Endpoints, and Estimands

Objectives
Endpoints
Primary
- To assess the non-inferiority of oral apixaban
compared to subcutaneous low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin for the
treatment of newly diagnosed proximal deep
vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary
embolism (PE) in patients with cancer.
-
Efficacy:
Incidence of objectively
confirmed recurrent Venous
Thromboembolism (VTE) at 6 months, a
composite of: Proximal Deep Vein
Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs,
Symptomatic DVT of the upper limb,
Pulmonary Embolism (PE).
-
Safety:
Incidence of major bleeding at 6
months, as defined by the International
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis
(ISTH) guidelines.
Secondary
- To compare the rates of the composite of
major and clinically relevant non-major
(CRNM) bleeding, and all bleeding events
between the apixaban and dalteparin groups.
- To assess the incidence of major bleeding
(MB) and clinically relevant non-major
bleeding (CRNMB).
- To evaluate rates of major bleeding in patient
subgroups.
- To compare the incidence of the Major
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) endpoint.
- To evaluate the individual components of the
primary efficacy outcome.
- To evaluate symptomatic recurrence of VTE.
- To evaluate all-cause death.
- To evaluate the composite of the primary
efficacy outcome plus major bleeding.
- To evaluate any major cardiovascular event.
- To assess Quality of Life (QoL).
- Composite of major bleeding and clinically
relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB).
- All bleeding events.
- Incidence of major bleeding (MB).
- Incidence of CRNMB.
- Major Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)
endpoint, a composite of proximal DVT, non-
fatal PE, and VTE-related death.
- Individual components of the primary
efficacy outcome.
- Symptomatic recurrence of VTE.
- All-cause death.
- Composite of primary efficacy outcome
plus major bleeding.
- Any major cardiovascular event, fatal or
non-fatal.
- Quality of Life (QoL) assessed according to
the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS).
[Tertiary/Exploratory/Other]
Objectives
Endpoints
- To conduct a sub-analysis to assess the
incidence of bleeding events according to
cancer site.
- Incidence of bleeding events (Major
Bleeding and CRNMB) according to the
primary cancer site (Gastrointestinal,
Genitourinary, Lung, Breast, Gynecological,
Hematological).

## 10.1.1 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following:
Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration
of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS)
international ethical guidelines.
Applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.
Applicable laws and regulations.
The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant
documents must be submitted to an IRB/IEC by the investigator and reviewed and
approved by the IRB/IEC before implementation.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/IEC approval before implementation of
changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an
immediate hazard to study participants.
Protocols and any substantial amendments to the protocol will require health authority
approval prior to initiation except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard
to study participants.
The investigator will be responsible for the following, as applicable:
Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC annually or more
frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the
IRB/IEC
Notifying the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by IRB/IEC
procedures.
Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to requirements of
21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European regulation 536/2014 for clinical studies
conducted in the EU, European Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 for clinical device
research, and all other applicable local regulations.

## 10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial
information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certific
‐
ation or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators will be
responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for
1 year after completion of the study.
## 10.1.3 Informed Consent Process
The investigator or the investigator’s representative will explain the nature of the study,
including the risks and benefits, to the potential participant or their legally authorized
representative and answer all questions regarding the study.
Potential participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary. They or their
legally authorized representatives will be required to sign a statement of informed consent
that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, and privacy
and data protection requirements, where applicable.
The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained
before the participant was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was
obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF.
Participants must be reconsented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their
participation in the study.
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or their legally authorized
representative.
Specific consent procedures may be required for rescreening, optional exploratory
research, and for participants who become pregnant. For complex studies, a 2-step consent
process may be utilized.
## 10.1.4 Recruitment strategy
The study-specific recruitment approach and tools used will be detailed in relevant study docu
‐
ments.
## 10.1.5 Data Protection
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any participant records or
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names
or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.
The participant must be informed that their personal study-related data will be used by the
sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
explained to the participant who will be required to give consent for their data to be used as
described in the informed consent.
The participant must be informed that their medical records may be examined by Clinical
Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.
The contract between the sponsor and study sites will specify the responsibilities of the
parties related to data protection, including the handling of data security breaches and the
respective communication and cooperation of the parties.
## 10.1.6 Committees Structure
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to oversee the safety of
the participants and the integrity of the study data. The IDMC will be composed of independent
members with relevant expertise. The committee will operate under a charter that defines its
responsibilities, which will include periodic review of accumulating data. The IDMC may recom
‐
mend modifications to the protocol or early termination of the study, as was the case in the
AVERROES study, which was stopped early due to clear evidence of benefit with an acceptable
safety profile. An Early Safety Data Review Committee may also be implemented for safety
signal detection, with predefined stopping rules based on events such as deaths or specific
SAEs.
## 10.1.7 Dissemination of Clinical Study Data
Study participants will be provided the option of receiving their individual study data. Manage
‐
ment of dissemination and the process for providing this option will be in accordance with
sponsor policies, laws, and regulations.
## 10.1.8 Data Quality Assurance
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRFs
unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The
investigator will be responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by
physically or electronically signing the CRF.
The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source documents.
Quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be predefined to identify systematic issues that can
impact participant safety and/or reliability of study results.
Monitoring details describing the strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives such as central, remote,
or on-site monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and requirements will be provided in the
monitoring plan and/or contracts.

•
The sponsor or designee will be responsible for the data management of this study,
including quality checking of the data.
The sponsor will assume accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (eg,
contract research organizations).
Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must
be retained by the investigator for a specified period after study completion as per local
regulations or institutional policies.
## 10.1.9 Source Documents
Source documents will provide evidence for the existence of the participant and
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents will be filed at the
investigator’s site.
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source
documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be
explained.
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the
information entered in the CRF.
The sponsor or designee will perform monitoring to confirm that data entered into the CRF
by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents;
that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being
conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.
## 10.1.10 Study and Site Start and Closure
## 10.1.10.1 First Act of Recruitment
The study start date will be the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of
participants. The first act of recruitment will be defined in the protocol.
## 10.1.10.2 Study/Site Termination
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any
time. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. The investigator may initiate study-site
closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given. Reasons
for early closure may include discontinuation of the study intervention development, failure to
comply with the protocol, or inadequate recruitment. If the study is prematurely terminated or
suspended,  the  sponsor  shall  promptly  inform  the  investigators,  the  IECs/IRBs,  and  the
regulatory authorities.

## 10.1.11 Publication Policy
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is
foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor
before submission. This will allow the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to
provide comments.
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support
publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee
of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) authorship requirements.

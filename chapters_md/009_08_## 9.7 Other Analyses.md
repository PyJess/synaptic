## 9.7 Other Analyses

## 9.7.1 Other variables and/or parameters
Additional parameters will be analyzed as specified.
## 9.7.2 Subgroup analyses
Predefined subgroup analyses will be conducted to evaluate the consistency of treatment ef
‚Äê
fects. These will include evaluating rates of major bleeding and the efficacy of apixaban versus
dalteparin in patient subgroups defined by cancer type, cancer treatment, and whether the VTE
was incidental versus symptomatic.
These analyses will explore whether safety and efficacy are consistent across subgroups and
will assess if patients with incidental VTE have a different risk profile for recurrence and major
bleeding compared to patients with symptomatic VTE.
Previous large-scale studies have shown the efficacy of apixaban to be generally consistent
across subgroups, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and renal function. This study
will further explore these relationships within the cancer patient population.

# 6. Study Intervention(s) and Concomitant Therapy

Study interventions will be all pre-specified, investigational and non-investigational medicinal
products, medical devices and other interventions intended to be administered to the study
participants during the study conduct.

Arm
Description
Patients will receive oral
apixaban 10 mg twice
daily (bid) for the first 7
days, followed by a
maintenance dose of 5 mg
bid for six months.
Patients will receive subcutaneous (SC)
dalteparin injection at a dose of 200 IU/kg
once daily (o.i.d) for the first month, followed
by a maintenance dose of 150 IU/kg o.i.d. for
the subsequent five months. The protocol may
allow for a potential transition to warfarin
within this group as per standard practice.

# 6.2 Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability
Apixaban will not require any special storage conditions. Dalteparin should be stored below
30°C and must not be frozen. It will be compatible with isotonic sodium chloride (9 mg/ml) or
isotonic glucose (50 mg/ml) infusion solutions in both glass bottles and plastic containers.
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Apixaban tablets may be crushed and
suspended in water, 5% glucose in water (G5W), or apple juice, or mixed with apple puree and
immediately administered orally. Crushed Apixaban tablets will be stable in these media for up to
4 hours. Alternatively, Apixaban tablets may be crushed, suspended in 60 mL of water or G5W,
and immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube.
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions will be
provided in the study reference manual.
# 6.3 Assignment to Study Intervention
Patients will be centrally and randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or dalteparin.
The protocol will include procedures for switching between treatments:
*
Switching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Apixaban:
When converting pa
‐
tients from VKA therapy to Apixaban, warfarin or other VKA therapy should be discontinued and
Apixaban started when the international normalised ratio (INR) is < 2.
*
Switching from Apixaban to VKA therapy:
When converting patients from Apixaban to VKA
therapy, administration of Apixaban should be continued for at least 2 days after beginning VKA
therapy. After 2 days of coadministration, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled
dose of Apixaban. Coadministration should be continued until the INR is ≥ 2.
# 6.4 [Blinding, Masking]
This will be an open-label study using a Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point
(PROBE) approach. Patients and investigators will be aware of treatment assignments. How
‐
ever, the outcome adjudication committee will be blinded to treatment allocation to minimize
bias.
# 6.5 Study Intervention Compliance
No information was provided in the source document.
# 6.6 Dose Modification
Apixaban:
No dose adjustment will be necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal
impairment. Apixaban will be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. For
patients with cancer and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), a VKA
is generally preferred over LMWH and DOACs.
Dalteparin:
Dose modifications will be permitted according to the product label and
investigator discretion, based on factors such as patient weight, renal function, and clinical
events (bleeding or thrombosis). The dose can be adjusted by increments/decrements of
500 IU or 1,000 IU. Criteria for dose adjustments will include the occurrence of minor
bleeding, prolonged access compression time (>10 minutes), or other clinical events.

# 6.7 Continued Access to Study Intervention after the End of
# the Study
Following the 6-month treatment period, long-term anticoagulation for secondary VTE prophylax
‐
is should be considered for patients with active cancer. The decision to continue anticoagulation
will depend on the type and stage of cancer, overall prognosis, periodic reevaluations of the risk
of recurrent VTE and bleeding, comorbidities, costs, and patients’ preferences.
# 6.8 Treatment of Overdose
For this study, any dose of apixaban that results in a higher risk of bleeding may be considered
an overdose.
In the event of an overdose or haemorrhagic complications, the investigator should:
- Discontinue treatment and investigate the source of bleeding.
- Consider the initiation of appropriate treatment, such as surgical haemostasis, transfusion of
fresh frozen plasma, or administration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors.
- A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) is available for adults. Administration of prothrombin
complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may also be considered [3, 4].
- Administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban overdose or
accidental ingestion.
- Haemodialysis is unlikely to be an effective means of managing apixaban overdose.
# 6.9 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, recreational
drugs, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of
enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with the reason for use, dates of
administration, and dosage information.
The following restrictions will apply:
- Participants must abstain from taking prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins
and herbal supplements) within 7 days (or 14 days for potential enzyme inducers) or 5 half-lives
(whichever is longer) before the start of study intervention, unless approved by the investigator
and sponsor.
- Concomitant use with other anticoagulants will be contraindicated, except as specified in the
protocol for treatment switching.
- Concomitant thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), aspirin over 165 mg
daily, or dual antiplatelet therapy will be prohibited.
- Concomitant use of strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, car
‐
bamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John’s Wort) with apixaban will be prohibited as efficacy may be
compromised.
Paracetamol/Acetaminophen at appropriate doses will be permitted. Care is to be taken if
patients are treated concomitantly with SSRIs, SNRIs, or NSAIDs, as these may increase bleed
‐
ing risk. The choice of anticoagulant must be based on the specific clinical setting after careful
consideration of potential drug-drug interactions.

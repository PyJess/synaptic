## 9.8 Interim Analyses

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to evaluate interim data.
The timing of interim analyses will be based on event-based triggers. The analyses will be
conducted using a group sequential design with an alpha spending approach to maintain the
overall type I error rate. Conditional power calculations may be performed to assess the probab
‚Äê
ility of study success, and the study may be stopped for futility if this power is low. All procedures
will be conducted in a manner that maintains the integrity of the study, with strict blinding
protocols for all personnel involved in the interim analysis.

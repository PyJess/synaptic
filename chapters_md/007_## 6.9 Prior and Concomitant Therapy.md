## 6.9 Prior and Concomitant Therapy

Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, recreational
drugs, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of
enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with the reason for use, dates of
administration, and dosage information.
The following restrictions will apply:
- Participants must abstain from taking prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins
and herbal supplements) within 7 days (or 14 days for potential enzyme inducers) or 5 half-lives
(whichever is longer) before the start of study intervention, unless approved by the investigator
and sponsor.
- Concomitant use with other anticoagulants will be contraindicated, except as specified in the
protocol for treatment switching.
- Concomitant thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), aspirin over 165 mg
daily, or dual antiplatelet therapy will be prohibited.
- Concomitant use of strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, car
‐
bamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John’s Wort) with apixaban will be prohibited as efficacy may be
compromised.
Paracetamol/Acetaminophen at appropriate doses will be permitted. Care is to be taken if
patients are treated concomitantly with SSRIs, SNRIs, or NSAIDs, as these may increase bleed
‐
ing risk. The choice of anticoagulant must be based on the specific clinical setting after careful
consideration of potential drug-drug interactions.

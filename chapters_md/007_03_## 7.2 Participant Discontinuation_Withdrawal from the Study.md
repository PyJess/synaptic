A participant may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety,
behavioral, or compliance reasons.
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should
be conducted, as shown in the SoA. See SoA for data to be collected at the time of study
discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
The participant will be permanently discontinued from the study intervention and the study
at that time.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
If a participant withdraws from the study, the participant may request destruction of any
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study
records.

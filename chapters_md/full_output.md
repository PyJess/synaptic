Objectives, Endpoints, and Estimands:
The trial will be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of
care (SOC), dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH), for the treatment of acute
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The study will evaluate apixaban for
non-inferiority to dalteparin for the primary outcome of recurrent VTE. Patients with active cancer
can be at high risk of both venous thromboembolism and bleeding events, and those who devel
‐
op VTE are at greater risk for recurrent VTE and early death. When apixaban is considered for
DVT or PE treatment in cancer patients, a careful assessment of the benefits against the risks
should be made, based on the patient’s individual risk for thrombosis and major bleeding after
full discussion of the potential benefits and harms. The rationale for this study is based on the
hypothesis that apixaban may be an effective and safe option for the treatment of VTE in this
population.

# 2. Introduction
Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa.
Its antithrombotic activity does not require antithrombin III. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound
factor Xa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effects on platelet aggregation,
but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. Through the inhibition of factor
Xa, apixaban prevents thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus development. This study
will compare apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), with dalteparin, a low-molecular-
weight heparin (LMWH), for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism in patients with
cancer. The risk of bleeding associated with DOACs appears to vary with cancer type and the
type of DOAC; a threefold to fourfold higher risk is reported for patients with GI cancers.
## 2.1 Study Rationale
The trial will be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of
care (SOC), dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH), for the treatment of acute
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The study will evaluate apixaban for
non-inferiority to dalteparin for the primary outcome of recurrent VTE. The rationale for this study
is based on the hypothesis that apixaban will demonstrate a favorable balance between desir
‐
able and undesirable effects for the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer, in the context of
current evidence and cost-effectiveness considerations.
## 2.2 Background
The study will enroll patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). Approxim
‐
ately 5% to 20% of patients with cancer develop a VTE, and approximately 20% of all VTE
cases occur in patients with cancer. Patients with active cancer can be at high risk of both
venous thromboembolism and bleeding events. Sites of cancer with the highest rates of VTE
include the pancreas, kidney, ovary, lung, and stomach. When apixaban is considered for DVT
or PE treatment in cancer patients, a careful assessment of the benefits against the risks should
be made. It should be noted that patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary
or metastatic cerebral cancers, known brain metastases, and acute leukaemia will be excluded
from this study.
Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa.
Its antithrombotic activity does not require antithrombin III. Apixaban functions by inhibiting both
free and clot-bound factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity. Through the inhibition of factor
Xa, apixaban prevents thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus development.
Previous clinical trials have evaluated apixaban against dalteparin for the treatment of VTE in
patients with cancer. The direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are
the only DOACs that were evaluated for the short-term treatment of VTE for patients with
cancer, and different DOACs have different drug-drug interactions.
## 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
## 2.3.1 Risk Assessment
The main safety endpoint for this trial will be major bleeding. Common adverse reactions
expected with these agents include haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, and haematoma. Safety
endpoints will include major bleeding, a composite of major and clinically relevant non-major
(CRNM)  bleeding,  and  all  bleeding  events.  As  with  other  anticoagulants,  patients  taking
apixaban will be carefully observed for signs of bleeding. Caution with direct factor Xa inhibitors
will be warranted in GI and genitourinary malignancies and other settings with high risk for
mucosal bleeding, as a threefold to fourfold higher risk of bleeding is reported for patients with
GI cancers. This study will assess the incidence of bleeding in both treatment groups, including
analyses  by  cancer  localization,  with  a  focus  on  patients  with  gastrointestinal  (GI)  and
genitourinary (GU) cancer.
## 2.3.2 Benefit Assessment
This study will assess whether apixaban is non-inferior to dalteparin for the treatment of cancer-
associated VTE. The primary efficacy outcome will be the incidence of recurrent VTE at 6
months. The study will also evaluate rates of recurrent VTE in subgroups of patients based on
cancer type, such as gynecological cancer, GI cancer, genitourinary cancer, and lung cancer.
## 2.3.3 Overall Benefit Risk Conclusion
This study is designed to test the hypothesis that apixaban has a favorable benefit-risk profile,
demonstrating non-inferiority for VTE recurrence with a similar risk of major bleeding compared
to LMWH (dalteparin). The study aims to provide high-quality evidence to support apixaban as a
treatment option for VTE in patients with cancer. The choice of treatment must be based on the
specific  clinical  setting  to  minimize  risk,  after  careful  consideration  of  potential  drug-drug
interactions, bleeding risk, patient preference, and the availability of treatment options, including
cost considerations.

recommended [1, 2].
Variable (or Endpoint):
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the time to first event of the
composite of recurrent VTE over 6 months. The primary safety endpoint will be the
incidence of major bleeding over 6 months.
Treatment Condition:
Apixaban versus dalteparin over a 6-month treatment period.
Intercurrent Events:
Not specified.
Population-Level Summary:
The primary outcome analysis will be based on time-to-event
data, for which a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be calculated.
Rationale:
The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority. The non-inferiority design is
based on the hypothesis that apixaban will provide a favorable balance between benefits
and harms.

Supplementary Estimand(s)
# 4. Study Design
## 4.1 Overall Design
This will be an international, multicenter, Phase IIIB/Phase 3, pivotal, interventional clinical study
involving approximately 1,170 patients. The study will employ a Prospective Randomized Open
Blinded End-point (PROBE) design, where patients and investigators will be aware of treatment
assignments, but outcome adjudication will be performed in a blinded manner. It will be charac
‐
terized as a pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority, active-controlled, event-driven, randomized
controlled trial.
The study will consist of a 6-month treatment period and will include both randomised and
preference cohorts. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or a low-
molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), dalteparin. The LMWH arm will include the potential for a
transition to warfarin. The treatment duration for both arms will be 6 months.
## 4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The trial will be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of
care (SOC), dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH), for the treatment of acute
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The primary objective will be to assess
the non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcutaneous dalteparin for treating newly
diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in this patient
population. The study is designed to test if apixaban meets pre-specified non-inferiority criteria.
Apixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa,
which does not require antithrombin III for its antithrombotic activity. It inhibits both free and clot-
bound factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity. While apixaban has no direct effects on
platelet aggregation, it indirectly inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. By inhibiting
factor Xa, apixaban is hypothesized to prevent thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus
development.
The ASH guideline panel suggests a DOAC (apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) over LMWH
for the short-term treatment (3-6 months) of VTE for patients with active cancer (conditional
recommendation, low certainty in the evidence of effects). The choice of treatment must be
based on the specific clinical setting to minimize risk, after careful consideration of potential
drug-drug interactions, bleeding risk, patient preference, and the availability of treatment options,
including cost.
## 4.2.1 Patient Input into Design
This trial will include an option for patients to complete a voluntary ‘Study Participant Feedback
Questionnaire’.  The  purpose  will  be  to  collect  feedback  on  their  clinical  trial  experience.
Individual participant responses will be anonymous to the investigator and site staff. Coded,
aggregated responses will be used by the sponsor to understand where improvements can be
made in the clinical trial process. This questionnaire will not collect data about the participant’s
disease, symptoms, treatment effect, or adverse events and will be analyzed and reported
separately from the clinical study data.
## 4.3 Justification for Dose
Administration  of  the  investigational  product  will  be  discontinued  if  a  severe  haemorrhage
occurs, or prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures that carry a risk of bleeding.
- Apixaban should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive
procedures with a moderate or high risk of bleeding, or where the risk of bleeding would be un
‐
acceptable.
- Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive
procedures with a low risk of bleeding, where any bleeding is expected to be minimal, non-
critical, or easily controlled.
- If surgery or invasive procedures cannot be delayed, appropriate caution should be exercised,
taking into consideration an increased risk of bleeding. This risk should be weighed against the
urgency of the intervention. Apixaban should be restarted after the procedure as soon as the
clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established.
The main safety endpoint and a potential dose-limiting toxicity for this trial will be major bleeding.
The study will assess and compare the rates of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major
bleeding between the apixaban and dalteparin arms. A sub-analysis will evaluate if rates of
major bleeding are higher in patients with certain cancer types, such as genitourinary and
gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. DOACs should be used carefully for patients with GI cancers
because of the higher risk of GI bleeding.
## 4.4 End-of-Study Definition
The end of the study will be defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study.
A participant will be considered to have completed the study if they have completed the 6-month
treatment period and the follow-up visit scheduled at 7 months from randomization. The primary
endpoint will be assessed at the conclusion of the 6-month treatment period.
Long-term anticoagulation for secondary VTE prophylaxis should be considered for patients with
active cancer. In the absence of contraindications, the benefits of long-term anticoagulation are
considered to outweigh the harms. This can be discontinued when patients are no longer at high
risk for recurrent VTEs or are entering the last weeks of life. The decision will depend on cancer
type and stage, prognosis, risk of VTE and bleeding, comorbidities, costs, and patient prefer
‐
ences.
# 5. Study Population
The study will enroll a total of 1,170 patients with cancer and symptomatic or incidental acute
proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The randomised cohort is
planned to include approximately 671 patients.

## 6.1.1 Rescue Medicine
No information was provided in the source document.
## 6.1.2 Medical Devices
No information was provided in the source document.
## 6.2 Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability
Apixaban will not require any special storage conditions. Dalteparin should be stored below
30°C and must not be frozen. It will be compatible with isotonic sodium chloride (9 mg/ml) or
isotonic glucose (50 mg/ml) infusion solutions in both glass bottles and plastic containers.
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Apixaban tablets may be crushed and
suspended in water, 5% glucose in water (G5W), or apple juice, or mixed with apple puree and
immediately administered orally. Crushed Apixaban tablets will be stable in these media for up to
4 hours. Alternatively, Apixaban tablets may be crushed, suspended in 60 mL of water or G5W,
and immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube.
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions will be
provided in the study reference manual.
## 6.3 Assignment to Study Intervention
Patients will be centrally and randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or dalteparin.
The protocol will include procedures for switching between treatments:
*
Switching from vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy to Apixaban:
When converting pa
‐
tients from VKA therapy to Apixaban, warfarin or other VKA therapy should be discontinued and
Apixaban started when the international normalised ratio (INR) is < 2.
*
Switching from Apixaban to VKA therapy:
When converting patients from Apixaban to VKA
therapy, administration of Apixaban should be continued for at least 2 days after beginning VKA
therapy. After 2 days of coadministration, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled
dose of Apixaban. Coadministration should be continued until the INR is ≥ 2.
## 6.4 [Blinding, Masking]
This will be an open-label study using a Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point
(PROBE) approach. Patients and investigators will be aware of treatment assignments. How
‐
ever, the outcome adjudication committee will be blinded to treatment allocation to minimize
bias.
## 6.5 Study Intervention Compliance
No information was provided in the source document.
## 6.6 Dose Modification
Apixaban:
No dose adjustment will be necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal
impairment. Apixaban will be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. For
patients with cancer and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), a VKA
is generally preferred over LMWH and DOACs.
Dalteparin:
Dose modifications will be permitted according to the product label and
investigator discretion, based on factors such as patient weight, renal function, and clinical
events (bleeding or thrombosis). The dose can be adjusted by increments/decrements of
500 IU or 1,000 IU. Criteria for dose adjustments will include the occurrence of minor
bleeding, prolonged access compression time (>10 minutes), or other clinical events.
•
•
## 6.7 Continued Access to Study Intervention after the End of
## the Study
Following the 6-month treatment period, long-term anticoagulation for secondary VTE prophylax
‐
is should be considered for patients with active cancer. The decision to continue anticoagulation
will depend on the type and stage of cancer, overall prognosis, periodic reevaluations of the risk
of recurrent VTE and bleeding, comorbidities, costs, and patients’ preferences.
## 6.8 Treatment of Overdose
For this study, any dose of apixaban that results in a higher risk of bleeding may be considered
an overdose.
In the event of an overdose or haemorrhagic complications, the investigator should:
- Discontinue treatment and investigate the source of bleeding.
- Consider the initiation of appropriate treatment, such as surgical haemostasis, transfusion of
fresh frozen plasma, or administration of a reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors.
- A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) is available for adults. Administration of prothrombin
complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant factor VIIa may also be considered [3, 4].
- Administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban overdose or
accidental ingestion.
- Haemodialysis is unlikely to be an effective means of managing apixaban overdose.
## 6.9 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, recreational
drugs, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of
enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with the reason for use, dates of
administration, and dosage information.
The following restrictions will apply:
- Participants must abstain from taking prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vitamins
and herbal supplements) within 7 days (or 14 days for potential enzyme inducers) or 5 half-lives
(whichever is longer) before the start of study intervention, unless approved by the investigator
and sponsor.
- Concomitant use with other anticoagulants will be contraindicated, except as specified in the
protocol for treatment switching.
- Concomitant thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), aspirin over 165 mg
daily, or dual antiplatelet therapy will be prohibited.
- Concomitant use of strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, car
‐
bamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John’s Wort) with apixaban will be prohibited as efficacy may be
compromised.
Paracetamol/Acetaminophen at appropriate doses will be permitted. Care is to be taken if
patients are treated concomitantly with SSRIs, SNRIs, or NSAIDs, as these may increase bleed
‐
ing risk. The choice of anticoagulant must be based on the specific clinical setting after careful
consideration of potential drug-drug interactions.
# 7. Discontinuation of Study Intervention and
# Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole will be detailed in Appendix 1.
## 7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study inter
‐
vention.  If  study  intervention  is  permanently  discontinued,  the  participant  should,  if  at  all
possible, remain in the study to be evaluated for study outcomes. See the SoA for data to be
collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up and for any further
evaluations that need to be completed.
Administration  of  the  investigational  product  will  be  discontinued  if  a  severe  haemorrhage
occurs, or prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures that carry a risk of bleeding. Apixaban
should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a
moderate or high risk of bleeding, and at least 24 hours prior for those with a low risk of
bleeding. Apixaban should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as
soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been es
‐
tablished. Permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety reasons will be a
secondary safety outcome.
## 7.1.1 Liver Event Stopping Criteria
Discontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver tests will be required by the investigator
when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the protocol-specified algorithm or in
the presence of abnormal liver chemistries not meeting protocol-specified stopping rules if the
investigator believes that it is in best interest of the participant.
## 7.1.2 QTc Stopping Criteria
If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to, changes from baseline
in QT interval corrected using Bazett’s formula [QTcB] or Fridericia’s formula [QTcF]) after
enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue on
the study intervention and if any change in participant management is needed. This review of
the ECG printed at the time of collection must be documented. Any new clinically relevant finding
should be reported as an AE.
## 7.1.3 Temporary Discontinuation
Temporary cessation of the study drug may be required for certain bleeding events considered
to have clinical consequences. Lapses in therapy should be avoided as discontinuing anticoagu
‐
lants places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. If anticoagulation with apixaban must be
temporarily discontinued for any reason, therapy should be restarted as soon as possible.
## 7.1.4 Rechallenge
This section will describe the procedures for restarting the intervention after stopping criteria
have been met.
## 7.1.4.1 Study Intervention Restart or Rechallenge After Liver Stopping Criteria Are
## Met
Study intervention restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met will be
allowed in this study. If the participant meets liver chemistry stopping criteria, do not restart or
rechallenge the participant with study intervention unless:
Sponsor board approval
is granted
Ethics and/or IRB approval is obtained, if required, and
Separate consent for intervention restart or rechallenge is signed by the participant
NOTE: If study intervention was interrupted for suspected intervention-induced liver
injury, the participant should be informed of the risk of death, liver transplantation,
hospitalization, and jaundice and reconsented before resumption of dosing.
Refer to Appendix 6 Liver Safety: Suggestions and Guidelines for Liver Events for details on the
restart or rechallenge process.
If sponsor board approval to restart or rechallenge the participant with study intervention is
not
granted
, then the participant must permanently discontinue study intervention and may continue
in the study for protocol-specified follow-up assessments.
## 7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at the participant’s own request for
any reason (or without providing any reason) without any negative consequences.
•
•
•
•
A participant may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety,
behavioral, or compliance reasons.
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should
be conducted, as shown in the SoA. See SoA for data to be collected at the time of study
discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
The participant will be permanently discontinued from the study intervention and the study
at that time.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
If a participant withdraws from the study, the participant may request destruction of any
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study
records.
## 7.3 Lost to Follow up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if the participant repeatedly fails to return for
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study
visit:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as
possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit
schedule, and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the
study.
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls, and if
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s
medical record.
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, the participant will be considered to have
withdrawn from the study.
Site personnel, or an independent third party, will attempt to collect the vital status of the
participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomized, including
those who did not get study intervention. Public sources may be searched for vital status
information. If vital status is determined as deceased, this will be documented and the
participant will not be considered lost to follow-up. Sponsor personnel will not be involved in
any attempts to collect vital status information.

# 8. Study Assessments and Procedures
Study procedures and their timing will be summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or
exemptions will not be allowed.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, will be
essential and required for study conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for
screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management and obtained
before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the
procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the timeframe
defined in the SoA.
In the event of a significant study-continuity issue (eg, caused by a pandemic), alternate
strategies for participant visits, assessments, medication distribution and monitoring may be
implemented by the sponsor or the investigator, as per local health authority/ethics
requirements.
Safety, laboratory, or analyte results that could unblind the study will not be reported to
investigative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.
Planned timepoints for all assessments will be provided in the SoA.
## 8.1 Administrative [and General/Baseline] Procedures
At screening, baseline characteristics will be recorded, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
diabetes,  and  coronary  artery  disease.  Based  on  historical  data  from  similar  trials  (e.g.,
ADVANCE-3), the expected prevalence of these comorbidities is approximately 46% for hyper
‐
tension, 10% for hyperlipidemia, 9% for diabetes, and 8% for coronary artery disease.
For context, this trial will exclude patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary
brain tumors, known brain metastases, or acute leukemia.
## 8.2 [Efficacy and/or Immunogenicity] Assessments
Efficacy will be assessed over the 6-month treatment period. Assessments will specifically
monitor for recurrent VTE, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and all-cause
deaths.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the incidence of objectively confirmed recurrent Venous
Thromboembolism (VTE), which will be a composite endpoint comprising:
- Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- Symptomatic DVT of the upper limb.
- Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (symptomatic or unsuspected).
Secondary efficacy outcomes will include the individual components of the primary efficacy
outcome, symptomatic recurrence of VTE, all-cause death, major cardiovascular events, and all
venous thromboembolic events.
## 8.3 Safety Assessments
Safety endpoints will be monitored throughout the 6-month treatment period. The main safety
endpoint and potential dose-limiting toxicity will be major bleeding. All bleeding criteria will
include surgical site bleeding.
## 8.3.1 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Height and weight
will also be measured and recorded.
A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs,
cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen).
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious
illnesses.
## 8.3.2 Vital Signs
Oral, tympanic, rectal, axillary, skin, or temporal artery temperature, pulse rate, respiratory
rate, and blood pressure will be recorded (before blood collection for laboratory tests).
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated
device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available.
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest
for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions.
For blood pressure measurements, 3 consecutive blood pressure readings will be recorded
at intervals of at least 1 minute. The average of the 3 blood pressure readings will be
recorded.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
## 8.3.3 Electrocardiograms
Triplicate or single 12-lead ECG(s) will be obtained as outlined in the SoA using an ECG
machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc
intervals. Refer to Section 7.1.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and any additional QTc readings
that may be necessary.
At each timepoint at which triplicate ECGs are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be
obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart.
## 8.3.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests
See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA (Section
1.3) for the timing and frequency.
The investigator must review the laboratory results, document this review, and record any
clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The laboratory results
must be retained with source documents.
Liver function testing will be performed prior to initiating apixaban.
Treatment with apixaban will not require routine monitoring of drug exposure. However, a
calibrated quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay may be useful in exceptional situations where
knowledge of apixaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g., overdose and
emergency surgery [5, 6].
All protocol-required laboratory tests, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in
accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA.
If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory tests performed at the
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered
clinically significant by the investigator, then the results must be recorded.
## 8.3.5 Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy will be an exclusion criterion. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must prac
‐
tice a medically accepted, highly effective method of contraception during the trial and for one
month beyond. Highly effective methods will include: combined hormonal contraception, proges
‐
togen-only hormonal contraception, intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing
system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence.
It is unknown whether apixaban or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A decision must
be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from apixaban therapy,
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the
woman.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
## 8.3.6 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring
As apixaban is not considered a CNS-active intervention, specific monitoring for suicidal ideation
and behavior (SIB) will not be mandated unless a participant’s underlying condition presents an
elevated risk. Should a participant experience signs of SIB, a risk assessment will be conducted.
All factors contributing to SIB will be evaluated, and consideration will be given to discontinu
‐
ation of the study intervention. Families and caregivers should be alerted to monitor participants
for unusual changes in behavior and report such symptoms immediately to the study investigat
‐
or.
## 8.4 Adverse Events (AEs) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs),
## and Other Safety Reporting
The definitions of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) can be found in
Appendix 3. Adverse events will be monitored with a particular focus on bleeding and clotting
events. Common adverse reactions expected will include haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis,
and haematoma. The use of apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or
overt bleeding from any tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The
investigator and any qualified designees will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
## 8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE
## Information
All SAEs and AEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the
final follow-up visit at 7 months. The primary monitoring period will cover the 6-month treatment
period. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining
informed consent will be recorded as medical history, not as AEs. All SAEs will be recorded and
reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed
24 hours.
## 8.4.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non
‐
leading verbal questioning of the participant will be the preferred method to inquire about AE
occurrences. Patients receiving apixaban will be carefully observed for any signs of bleeding.
Specific signs and symptoms of bleeding to monitor for will include bruising or bleeding under
the skin, tar-coloured stools, blood in urine, epistaxis, dizziness, tiredness, paleness, weakness,
sudden severe headache, and coughing up or vomiting blood.
## 8.4.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After  the  initial  AE/SAE  report,  the  investigator  will  be  required  to  proactively  follow  each
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and AEs of special interest (as defined in
Section 8.4.8) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or
the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3).
## 8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE will be essential so that
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants are met.
The sponsor will have a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical
investigation.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE will review and
then file it and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse
reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and
forwarded to investigators within 15 days.
## 8.4.5 Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in participants able to give birth will be collected after the start of
study intervention and until the time period for post-intervention contraception has passed.
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the
appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.
While pregnancy itself will not be considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE.
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered SAEs and will be reported as such.
The investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant, the pregnancy outcome,
and the neonate.
## 8.4.6 Cardiovascular and Death Events
Assessment of any major cardiovascular event (fatal or non-fatal, including acute myocardial
infarction or ischemic stroke) and all-cause death will be secondary objectives of this study.

## 8.4.7 Disease-related Events and/or Disease-related Outcomes Not
## Qualifying as AEs or SAEs
Certain disease-related events (DREs) that are common in participants with the disease under
study may not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs,
even if they meet the SAE definition. However, if the event is of greater intensity, frequency, or
duration than expected for the individual, or if the investigator considers there is a reasonable
possibility that the event was related to the study intervention, it must be reported as an AE/SAE.
## 8.4.8 Adverse Events of Special Interest
The primary safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding, as defined by the Interna
‐
tional  Society  on  Thrombosis  and  Haemostasis  (ISTH)  guidelines.  All  bleeding  criteria  will
include surgical site bleeding.
Major Bleeding:
An event will be characterized as acute, clinically overt bleeding
associated with one or more of the following criteria:
A decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (1.2 mmol/L) or more.
The transfusion of two or more units of packed red blood cells.
Bleeding that occurs in at least one critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular,
pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or
retroperitoneal).
Bleeding that is fatal.
Bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention.
Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding (CRNMB):
An acute, clinically overt bleeding
event that does not meet the criteria for major bleeding and consists of one of the following:
Any bleeding that compromises hemodynamics.
Spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm², or 100 cm² if traumatic.
Intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography.
Epistaxis or gingival bleeding requiring intervention, or venipuncture bleeding lasting >5
minutes.
Macroscopic hematuria that is spontaneous or lasts >24 hours post-procedure.
Hemoptysis, hematemesis, or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring intervention.
Any other bleeding event considered to have clinical consequences (requiring medical
intervention, unscheduled contact, temporary drug cessation, or associated with pain/
impairment).

This study will assess the incidence of major bleeding and CRNMB in both treatment arms, with
a particular focus on whether the incidence is higher in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) and
genitourinary (GU) cancer.
## 8.4.9 Medical Device Deficiencies
Medical devices will not be provided for use in this study. This section is not applicable.
## 8.4.9.1 Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Deficiencies
Not applicable.
## 8.4.9.2 Follow-up of Medical Device Deficiencies
Not applicable.
## 8.4.9.3 Prompt Reporting of Device Deficiencies to the Sponsor
Not applicable.
## 8.4.9.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Device Deficiencies
Not applicable.
## 8.5 Pharmacokinetics
In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the mean terminal half-life of anti-Factor Xa activity
following a single intravenous dose of 5,000 IU dalteparin was 5.7 ± 2.0 hours, which is consid
‐
erably longer than in healthy volunteers, suggesting greater accumulation can be expected.
## 8.6 Pharmacodynamics
While standard clotting tests will be affected as expected by the drug’s mechanism of action,
these changes will not be recommended for assessing its pharmacodynamic effects. Apixaban
prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin
time (aPTT), but these are subject to a high degree of variability and will not be recommended
for routine assessment of the pharmacodynamic effect. The thrombin generation assay may be
used to measure the reduction in endogenous thrombin potential.
## 8.7 Genetics
A blood or saliva sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consen
‐
ted to participate in the genetic analysis component of the study. Participation will be optional.
Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the
main study. In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic sample may be
requested from the participant.
## 8.8 Biomarkers
Samples will be collected to achieve protocol-specific objectives. Details on sample types,
collection schedules, and handling will be provided in the laboratory manual. With participant
consent, samples may be stored for a specified number of years after the end of the study for
further research to contribute to the understanding of the disease, related conditions, or the
development of new treatments.
## 8.9 Immunogenicity Assessments
Antibodies to the study intervention will be evaluated in plasma/serum samples collected from all
participants according to the SoA, including those who discontinue. Samples will be screened for
binding antibodies, and the titer of confirmed positive samples will be reported. The detection
and characterization of antibodies will be performed using a validated assay method.
## 8.10 [Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and
## Health Economics]
For all participants throughout the study, the investigator and study site personnel will collect
data  about  health  care  resource  utilization  associated  with  medical  encounters.  The  data
collected will include the reasons and duration of hospitalizations and emergency room visits,
and will exclude procedures, tests, and encounters mandated by the protocol. Quality of Life
(QoL) will be assessed according to the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS).
# 9. Statistical Considerations
## 9.1 General Considerations
## 9.1.1 Decision Criteria/Statistical Hypotheses
The primary objective will be to assess the non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcu
‐
taneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed
proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer
[7, 8]. The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority, and the primary outcome analysis will
be based on time-to-event data. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be cal
‐
culated.
The null and alternative hypotheses will be formulated to support this non-inferiority objective.
Nominal significance levels, confidence interval probabilities, and the use of 1- or 2-sided tests
will be prespecified.
Previous studies provide context for this non-inferiority framework. For example, the AMPLIFY
study for VTE treatment showed apixaban to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin (p < 0.0001).
This study will be designed to test for a similar non-inferiority outcome in the specified cancer
patient population.
Hypotheses for secondary objectives will also be defined, potentially including both non-inferior
‐
ity  and  superiority  testing  frameworks.  The  rationale  for  the  non-inferiority  margin  and  its
operational evaluation will be detailed.
## 9.1.2 Multiplicity Adjustment
To control the overall type I error in the trial, a closed testing procedure will be implemented to
manage the family-wise error rate [9, 10]. Key secondary endpoints, such as major bleeding and
all-cause death, may be tested using a pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy. This fixed
sequence testing procedure will ensure that subsequent hypotheses are tested only if the
preceding  ones  are  statistically  significant  at  their  prespecified  levels.  The  step-by-step
hierarchical testing procedures and strategies for Type I error control will be fully defined.
## 9.1.3 Impact of Intercurrent Events Strategies
Strategies for handling intercurrent events will be defined for the analysis to ensure a robust
interpretation of the results.
## 9.1.4 Handling of Missing Data
Procedures and statistical methods for managing and imputing missing data will be prespecified
to minimize bias in the analyses.
## 9.2 Analysis Sets
For the purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets will be defined:
-
Full Analysis Set (FAS):
All randomized participants.
-
Safety Analysis Set (SAS):
All participants who are exposed to the investigational interven
‐
tion.
The study will include both randomised and preference cohorts. The randomized cohort will
include approximately 671 patients with cancer and either symptomatic or incidentally diagnosed
VTE. Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS, with participants analyzed according to
their planned investigational intervention. Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS, with
participants analyzed according to the investigational intervention they actually received.
Specific  exclusion  criteria  will  be  applied  to  the  analysis  cohort.  Patients  with  primary  or
metastatic cerebral cancers and those with acute leukaemia will be excluded. Following the
precedent of similar trials, patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary brain
tumors, or known brain metastases will also be excluded. Furthermore, patients with lesions or
conditions considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding, such as recent brain or spinal
injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, or recent intracranial haemorrhage, will be ex
‐
cluded.
## 9.3 Analyses Supporting Primary Objective(s)
## 9.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)/Estimand(s)
## 9.3.1.1 Definition of endpoint(s)
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:
The primary efficacy outcome will be the incidence of the first event of the composite of
objectively confirmed recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or VTE-related death occurring
during the study period. This composite endpoint will include:
- Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- Symptomatic DVT of the upper limb.
- Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (symptomatic or unsuspected).
- VTE-related death.
Primary Safety Endpoint:
The primary safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding, as defined by the Interna
‐
tional Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. A major bleeding event will be
an acute, clinically overt bleeding event associated with one or more of the following:
- A decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (1.2 mmol/L) or more.
- Transfusion of two or more units of packed red blood cells.
- Bleeding that occurs in a critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-
articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal).
- Bleeding that is fatal.
- Bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention.
## 9.3.1.2 Main Analytical Approach
The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority. The primary statistical analysis for the efficacy
endpoint, which is the time to the first event of the composite of recurrent VTE, will be a time-to-
event analysis. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be calculated to assess
non-inferiority. This approach is supported by findings from similar trials in related indications.
## 9.3.1.3 Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary endpoint results
under different assumptions and analytical approaches.
## 9.3.1.4 Supplementary Analyses
Additional supplementary analyses may be performed to further support the primary objectives.
## 9.4 Analyses Supporting Secondary Objective(s)
## 9.4.1 Analyses Supporting Secondary Objective [label]
Statistical analyses will be performed for all secondary endpoints.
Secondary Safety Outcomes:
-
Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding (CRNMB):
An acute, clinically overt bleeding event
not meeting major bleeding criteria but requiring medical intervention, an unscheduled physician
contact, temporary cessation of the study drug, or associated with pain or impairment of daily
activities. Specific examples will include spontaneous large hematomas, significant epistaxis,
macroscopic hematuria, or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring endoscopy.
-
Composite Safety Outcomes:
- The composite of major bleeding and CRNMB.
- Permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety reasons.
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes:
- The individual components of the primary efficacy outcome.
- Symptomatic recurrence of VTE.
- All-cause death.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus all-cause death.
- The composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding plus all-cause death.
- Any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal (including acute myocardial infarction or
ischemic stroke).
- All venous thromboembolic events (including splanchnic and cerebral vein thrombosis).
- Major VTE endpoint (composite of proximal DVT, non-fatal PE, and VTE-related death).
Quality of Life (QoL):
- QoL will be assessed using the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS).
Subgroup Analyses:
- Analyses will be conducted on patient subgroups defined by cancer type, cancer treatment,
and whether the initial VTE was incidental versus symptomatic.
## 9.5 Analyses Supporting Tertiary/Exploratory/Other
## Objective(s)
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to further investigate treatment effects. A sub-analysis
will assess the incidence of bleeding events (Major Bleeding and CRNMB) according to cancer
site, including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, lung, breast, gynaecological, and haematological
cancers. This analysis will explore whether the incidence of bleeding is highest in patients with
certain cancer types, such as gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancer, particularly if the cancer
is not resected. It will also assess if rates of recurrent VTE are highest in specific cancer sub
‐
groups.
Additionally, analyses will be conducted combining patients across treatment arms to identify
patient characteristics associated with a higher overall risk of VTE recurrence or major bleeding,
recognizing that patients with active cancer are at high risk for both.
## 9.6 Other Safety Analyses
A comprehensive safety analysis will be performed, comparing rates of bleeding events between
the apixaban and dalteparin arms. The main safety endpoint and potential dose-limiting toxicity
for this trial will be major bleeding. Safety endpoints monitored throughout the study will include
major bleeding, the composite of major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and
all bleeding events. Common adverse reactions expected will include anaemia, thrombocyt
‐
openia, haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, haematoma, and nausea.
Context from previous studies, such as the AMPLIFY VTE treatment study, will inform the safety
assessment. In that study, major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of apixaban patients versus 1.8% of
enoxaparin/warfarin patients, and the composite of major and CRNM bleeding occurred in 4.3%
versus 9.7%, respectively.
## 9.7 Other Analyses
## 9.7.1 Other variables and/or parameters
Additional parameters will be analyzed as specified.
## 9.7.2 Subgroup analyses
Predefined subgroup analyses will be conducted to evaluate the consistency of treatment ef
‐
fects. These will include evaluating rates of major bleeding and the efficacy of apixaban versus
dalteparin in patient subgroups defined by cancer type, cancer treatment, and whether the VTE
was incidental versus symptomatic.
These analyses will explore whether safety and efficacy are consistent across subgroups and
will assess if patients with incidental VTE have a different risk profile for recurrence and major
bleeding compared to patients with symptomatic VTE.
Previous large-scale studies have shown the efficacy of apixaban to be generally consistent
across subgroups, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and renal function. This study
will further explore these relationships within the cancer patient population.
## 9.8 Interim Analyses
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to evaluate interim data.
The timing of interim analyses will be based on event-based triggers. The analyses will be
conducted using a group sequential design with an alpha spending approach to maintain the
overall type I error rate. Conditional power calculations may be performed to assess the probab
‐
ility of study success, and the study may be stopped for futility if this power is low. All procedures
will be conducted in a manner that maintains the integrity of the study, with strict blinding
protocols for all personnel involved in the interim analysis.
## 9.9 Sample Size Determination
A total of approximately 1,155 to 1,170 patients will be enrolled in the study. The randomised
cohort is planned to include approximately 671 patients. The sample size calculation will be
based on the primary efficacy estimand and will provide sufficient statistical power to test the
primary hypothesis at a prespecified type-1 error level, using a normal approximation method for
a 2-sided test. Assumptions for the calculation, including those related to intercurrent events and
expected event rates informed by previous large-scale trials, will be detailed.
For context, similar large-scale trials such as the AMPLIFY study randomized 5,395 patients.

NOTES:
Exclusion Criteria:
Hemoglobin level < 8 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L) or a platelet count < 75x10⁹/L.
Creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault). Apixaban use will be cautioned in
patients with creatinine clearance of 15-29 mL/min and not recommended for those with
clearance < 15 mL/min or on dialysis.
Liver Safety:
Liver function testing will be performed prior to initiating apixaban.
Patients will be excluded if Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is ≥3 times the upper limit
of normal (ULN) and/or a bilirubin level is ≥2 times the ULN.
Apixaban will be contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with
coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk.
Coagulation Tests:
Clotting tests (e.g., PT, INR, aPTT) will be affected by apixaban, but changes are variable.
Routine monitoring will not be required, but a calibrated quantitative anti-Factor Xa assay
may be useful in exceptional situations like overdose or emergency surgery.
In studies with dalteparin in patients with end-stage renal failure, no evidence of
bioaccumulation of anti-Factor Xa serum levels was observed.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.
## 10.3 Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures
## for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
## 10.3.1 Definition of AE
## 10.3.1.1 AE Definition
An AE will be any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study
intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with
the use of study intervention.
## 10.3.1.2 Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE
An unsolicited AE will be an AE that was not solicited using a participant diary and that is
communicated by a participant or their representative.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Solicited AEs will be predefined local and systemic events for which the participant is
specifically questioned.
## 10.3.1.3 Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results or other safety assessments considered clinically
significant by the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition.
New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction or overdose.
Common adverse reactions expected with the study agents will include haemorrhage,
contusion, epistaxis, haematoma, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea. The use of
apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any
tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia.
## 10.3.1.4 Events not Meeting the AE Definition
Abnormal findings associated with the underlying disease, unless more severe than
expected.
The disease being studied or its expected progression, unless more severe than expected.
A medical or surgical procedure itself; the condition leading to the procedure will be the AE.
Hospital admission for social or convenience reasons.
Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing conditions that do not worsen.
## 10.3.2 Definition of SAE
An SAE will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or
more of the criteria listed:
a.
Results in death
b.
Is life threatening
c.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
d.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
e.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.
Is  a  suspected  transmission  of  any  infectious  agent  via  an  authorized  medicinal
product
g.
Other situations:
Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening but
may jeopardize the participant or require intervention to prevent one of the other serious out
‐
comes.

•
•
•
•
•
## 10.3.3 Recording and Follow-Up of AE and/or SAE
## 10.3.3.1 AE and SAE Recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, the investigator must review all related documentation and record
all relevant information. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the duration of the study, with a particular
focus on bleeding and clotting events.
## 10.3.3.2 Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will assess the intensity of each AE and SAE as:
-
Mild:
Usually transient, minimal or no treatment required, does not interfere with daily activit
‐
ies.
-
Moderate:
Alleviated with specific intervention, interferes with daily activities.
-
Severe:
Interrupts daily activities, significantly affects clinical status, or requires intensive inter
‐
vention.
## 10.3.3.3 Assessment of Causality
The investigator must assess the relationship between the study intervention and each AE/
SAE, considering alternative causes and the temporal relationship. A
reasonable possibility
of a relationship will suggest a causal link. The investigator will consult the IB and/or product
information. This assessment will be crucial for regulatory reporting.
## 10.3.3.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
The investigator will be obligated to perform supplemental evaluations as medically
indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. If a participant dies, a
copy of any postmortem findings will be provided to the sponsor. New or updated
information will be recorded, and any updated SAE data will be submitted to the sponsor
within 24 hours of receipt.
## 10.3.4 Reporting of SAEs
## 10.3.4.1 SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the sponsor will be the electronic data
collection tool. If the electronic system is unavailable, the site will use the paper SAE data
collection tool to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the
electronic system as soon as it becomes available.
•
•
•
•
## 10.3.4.2 SAE Reporting to the Sponsor via Paper Data Collection Tool
In the event the electronic system is unavailable, facsimile transmission of the paper SAE
data collection tool will be the preferred method. Notification by telephone will be acceptable
in rare circumstances but will not replace the need to complete and sign the SAE data
collection tool within the designated reporting timeframes.
## 10.4 Appendix 4: Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance
## 10.4.1 Definitions
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will be defined as those who are biologically capable
of becoming pregnant.
## 10.4.2 Contraception Guidance
WOCBP must practice a medically accepted, highly effective method of contraception
during the trial and for one month after the last dose of the study drug.
Highly effective methods will include: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)
hormonal contraception, progestogen-only hormonal contraception, intrauterine device
(IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, a
vasectomized partner, or true sexual abstinence.
Pregnancy or breastfeeding will be exclusionary criteria for study participation. There are no
data from the use of apixaban in pregnant women; as a precautionary measure, it is
preferable to avoid its use during pregnancy. It is unknown if apixaban or its metabolites are
excreted in human milk; therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue
breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from the study drug.
Animal studies with apixaban have shown no effect on fertility.
## 10.5 Appendix 5: Genetics
Where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA analysis from
consenting participants. DNA samples will be used for research related to the study intervention,
the indication, and related diseases. This may include pharmacogenomic analysis, candidate
gene analysis, or genome-wide analysis to understand how genetic variation impacts drug re
‐
sponse, disease susceptibility, and progression [11, 12]. Samples will be stored securely to
protect confidentiality and will be retained for a specified period as per local requirements.
•
•
•
•
•
## 10.6 Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggestions and Guidelines
## for Liver Events
Patients will be excluded from the study if they have acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis,
or liver cirrhosis.
Patients will also be excluded if their alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is ≥3 times the
upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or their bilirubin level is ≥2 times the ULN.
Apixaban will be contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with
coagulopathy and a clinically relevant bleeding risk. It will not be recommended for patients
with severe hepatic impairment and should be used with caution in those with mild or
moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or B).
Liver function testing will be performed prior to initiating apixaban.

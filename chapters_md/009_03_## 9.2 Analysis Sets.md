tion.
The study will include both randomised and preference cohorts. The randomized cohort will
include approximately 671 patients with cancer and either symptomatic or incidentally diagnosed
VTE. Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS, with participants analyzed according to
their planned investigational intervention. Safety analyses will be conducted on the SAS, with
participants analyzed according to the investigational intervention they actually received.
Specific  exclusion  criteria  will  be  applied  to  the  analysis  cohort.  Patients  with  primary  or
metastatic cerebral cancers and those with acute leukaemia will be excluded. Following the
precedent of similar trials, patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary brain
tumors, or known brain metastases will also be excluded. Furthermore, patients with lesions or
conditions considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding, such as recent brain or spinal
injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, or recent intracranial haemorrhage, will be ex

cluded.

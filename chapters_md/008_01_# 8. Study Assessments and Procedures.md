# 8. Study Assessments and Procedures

Study procedures and their timing will be summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or
exemptions will not be allowed.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, will be
essential and required for study conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for
screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participantâ€™s routine clinical management and obtained
before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the
procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the timeframe
defined in the SoA.
In the event of a significant study-continuity issue (eg, caused by a pandemic), alternate
strategies for participant visits, assessments, medication distribution and monitoring may be
implemented by the sponsor or the investigator, as per local health authority/ethics
requirements.
Safety, laboratory, or analyte results that could unblind the study will not be reported to
investigative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.
Planned timepoints for all assessments will be provided in the SoA.

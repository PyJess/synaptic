__TransCelerate Common Protocol Template v10__

__About This Template__

__Disclaimer__

This document is a common protocol template\. It contains sections marked as common text that may be used across protocols with little to no editing if the user chooses to do so\. The use of this template is at the discretion of the user\. Recommendations for modifications in future releases of the common protocol template can be submitted at any time and will be reviewed on a routine basis\.

These materials are provided AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT\. TransCelerate and its members do not accept any responsibility for any loss of any kind including loss of revenue, business, anticipated savings or profits, loss of goodwill or data, or for any indirect consequential loss whatsoever to any person using these materials or acting or refraining from action as a result of the information contained in these materials\. Any party using these materials bears sole and complete responsibility for ensuring that the materials, whether modified or not, are suitable for the particular use and are accurate, current, commercially reasonable under the circumstances, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations\. 

Nothing in this template should be construed to represent or warrant that persons using this template have complied with all applicable laws and regulations\. All individuals and organizations using this template bear responsibility for complying with the applicable laws and regulations for the relevant jurisdiction\.

__Components of the Protocol Template__

- The__ Core Backbone__ contains protocol information common to all phases, study populations, and therapeutic areas\. The core backbone is streamlined and focused on the sites’ needs\. 
- __Libraries__ group and store content that will be inserted into the core backbone and contain specific information related to therapeutic area, study intervention, country, and study population \(eg, patient, healthy volunteer\)\. For pediatric or adult/pediatric studies, include the content contained in the pediatric library\.
- __Appendices__ provide additional information that can be accessed when needed \(eg, abbreviations, standard content regarding adverse event \[AE\] definitions\)\.

__Core Backbone Headings__

- Level 1 and 2 headings should be consistent across protocols that use the CPT for reference and mapping purposes\. The structure of this template was chosen to maximize alignment with the structure of the United States National Institutes of Health \(NIH\) and Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) Clinical Trials Protocol Template\.
- Level 1 and 2 headings should not be deleted\. If they are not relevant to the study, not applicable should be inserted so that the numbering of subsequent sections is not changed\.
- Level 3 and subsequent headings are suggested and can be deleted/added/modified as needed with the exception of those in Section 8\.4 relating to Adverse Events, which are International Council for Harmonisation \(ICH\)\-/regulatory agency\-required wording and must be included\.

__Terminology__

- The following terminology has been selected for use within TransCelerate common templates \(protocol, statistical analysis plan \[SAP\], and clinical study report \[CSR\]\) and is considered to be appropriate for all phases, study populations, and therapeutic areas\.
	- *Participant* is used rather than subject, healthy volunteer, or patient when referring to an individual who has consented to participate in the clinical study\. *Patient* or *individual* is used to describe the population represented by the study participants\. All references to male & female pertain to sex assigned at birth, most often based on the infant’s physical characteristics\.
	- *Study intervention* is used rather than study drug\.  *Study interventions* are all pre\-specified, investigational and non\-investigational medicinal products\*, medical devices and other interventions \(eg, surgical and behavioral\) intended to be administered to the study participants during the study conduct\.  Procedures conducted to manage participants or to collect data are excluded from the usage of this term\.  Investigational interventions are a subset of study interventions that are being tested or used as a control \(eg, placebo or active comparator\)\.

\*	Refer to Eudralex \- Volume 10 \- Clinical trials guidelines \(Chapter III\) for further information on some categories of medicinal products which are normally used in clinical trials as NIMPs, such as rescue medication, challenge agents, medicinal products used to assess endpoints in the clinical trial, concomitant medicinal products systematically prescribed to the study participants, and background treatment\. Of note, all products administered during the study that are not study interventions are recorded as “concomitant therapy”\.

- 
	- *Effectiveness* is used for medical device studies whereas for drugs, *efficacy* is used\. The template should be updated as appropriate\.

__Formatting and Text Conventions__

- Common Text: Black font preceded by *<Start of common text>* and followed by *<End of common text>* is common language intended to be harmonized across protocols\. The recommendation is to use this text as written to maintain consistency across template users, but the text can be adapted or deleted if required\.  __Driver:__ Industry regulation or guidance\.
- Suggested Text: Black text preceded by *<Start of suggested text>* and followed by *<End of suggested text>* is suggested language that can be adapted or deleted as needed\. Authors should consider implications to reuse within the CTS or for CT Registry if text is to be modified or removed\.
- Variable Text: Blue bracketed text is variable text that should be addressed based on individual study needs\.
- Example Text: Green italicized text preceded by *<Start of example text>* and followed by *<End of example text>* should be removed by the author if not utilized\. 
- Instructional Text: Is intended to aid in authoring of the protocol in this template\. In the Basic Word Edition, it is red, hidden text, and paragraph marks must be enabled in order for it to be displayed\. When attempting to access instructional text from the Basic Word Edition for use outside of the template \(eg, hyperlinks\), the content will need to be converted from hidden to unhidden text for it to be visible in other applications\. In the Technology\-enabled Edition, it will appear only in the Instructional Text panel\.

The flags for the start and end of common, suggested, or example text can be removed automatically at the time of CPT finalization if the eCPT template has been used or should be removed manually by the author if the Basic Word Edition CPT template has been used\.

All language proposed in this template \(whether proposed as common, suggested, example, or variable text\) may be modified as the user sees fit or as required by any applicable law or regulation\.  

__Guidance for Complex Study Designs__

- The following terminology has been selected for use for complex trials:
	- Master Protocol: The document which describes the overall clinical study design applicable to all related interventions or populations such as the clinical study rationale, objectives, endpoints, benefit\-risk assessment, shared procedures regarding safety monitoring and reporting, and a common screening platform dictating participant eligibility and/or treatment allocation \(CTFG, 2019\)\. Sub\-protocol:  The document which describes the specific features of an intervention\-specific or sub\-population/disease\-specific sub\-study\. Each intervention or population may have a separate sub\-protocol\. 
	- Together, a master protocol and sub\-protocol\(s\) define all the elements needed to conduct a study\. 
- Separate CPT documents should be used to capture all the details of the master protocol and each associated sub\-protocol\.
- For protocol sections not being utilized provide a reference to the content location\. \(eg, “Intervention details can be found in the master protocol/sub\-protocol…”\) or NA if not applicable\. Avoid unnecessary duplication of information whenever possible\.

- Include a brief description of the reasons for doing the study and for doing it at this time\. For example, include any key issues for the compound that are being addressed \(eg, variable exposure addressed with a new formulation or dosing with food\)\.
- For device studies, include populations and indications for which the investigational device is intended\.
- This section should be aligned with the overall development plan for the compound\.
- This rationale should be based on the results of previous studies \(if relevant\) and the characteristics of the disease entity and should be of scientific merit\. 
- For complex trials, provide the rationale for conducting a complex trial instead of an independent study for each intervention or sub\-population\. 

## <a id="_Toc421709230"></a><a id="_Toc477961590"></a><a id="_Toc155184160"></a>Background

This section should be brief \(1/2 to 1 page\) as the majority of the information is available in existing documents\. Include a 1\- to 2\-sentence description of why the investigational intervention is being developed for the disease \(eg, unmet medical need, easier administration, better efficacy expected, better side effect profile\)\. State whether this is a novel class of compounds or a new compound within an established class, and whether this class of compounds has been used before in the therapeutic area\. Briefly refer to literature and data relevant to the study\.

For studies using an unlicensed investigational intervention: include a very brief summary of key nonclinical/clinical data relevant to the development of the compound and pharmacodynamic/efficacy findings that support development for the indication\. Do not duplicate data already summarized in the IB/IDFU/package insert; a reference to the specific IB/IDFU/package insert section is sufficient\. When referencing information in the IB/IDFU/package insert or other relevant documents, provide a reference to the section or table where the data are presented\.

For studies using marketed compounds or comparators: see the manufacturer’s label \(include as a reference in Section 11\) or provide a brief description of relevant information\. To avoid copyright infringements, do not include a copy of the approved product label in the protocol\.

- Provide a brief assessment of the benefits and risks of study participation\. Information should align with the IB, package insert/prescribing information \(if applicable\), IDFU \(for a device product\) and investigational medicinal product dossier \(IMPD\) \(if applicable\)\.
- Consider the known and expected benefits and potential risks of the investigational intervention\(s\), any significant risks associated with study procedures \(biopsies, etc\) or design \(placebo arm, etc\), and any measures to control the risks\. Cross reference Section 4 Study Design for details of study procedures, dose, and study design justification\. 
- For an investigational device include risk/benefit analysis from device risk analysis report and details of anticipated serious adverse device effects \(SADEs\)\.
- The benefit/risk assessment may include a description of the types of events anticipated in the specific study population \(eg, hypoglycemic events are anticipated in a Type 1 diabetes participant, and arrhythmias are anticipated in a participant with Class III/IV heart failure\)\.
- Outcomes of discussions with regulatory authorities as related to benefit/risk and reporting may be summarized here if they provide useful insights for the investigator\. 
- For studies on drug\-device combination \(DDC\) products, the benefit\-risk assessment needs to take into consideration the DDC as a whole \(ie, not only the drug\)\.

<a id="_Hlk17727851"></a>__Investigational Intervention__ \- Discuss risks related to the investigational intervention\(s\)\. Refer to the IB \(including section number\) for a thorough description of risks related to the intervention generally\. Consider the guidance in the DSUR Evaluation of Risks Section 18\.1 when taking an inventory of potential risk topics\. For the protocol, focus the discussion only on the relevant risks for THIS study\. For example, consider the study\-specific details that address risks related to investigational intervention \(eg, starting dose, dose increments, dose escalation, administration of doses, stopping rules\) and the resources required by site\(s\) \(particularly in terms of facilities and staff, procedures, patient population, staff training\)\. Provide a brief description of strategies to mitigate these risks or provide a cross reference to the relevant protocol section \(eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria, participant monitoring, withdrawal criteria, dose selection, comparison to nonclinical no effect levels, duration of dosing\)\.

__Study Procedures__ \- Consider risks associated with the study design and procedures specific to THIS study \(eg, biopsies\) or design \(eg, placebo arm\), and any measures to control the risks\. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible risks associated with study procedures but should focus on the unique risks inherent in the design or less common or high\-risk procedures\. Cross reference Section 4 Study Design for details of study procedures, dose, and study design justification\.  Provide a brief description of strategies to mitigate these risks or provide a cross reference to the relevant protocol section \(eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria, participant monitoring, withdrawal criteria, dose selection, comparison to nonclinical no effect levels, duration of dosing\)\. 

__Other __\- Consider risks associated with other study interventions \(eg, comparators, challenge agents, imaging agents, medical devices\)\. Insert a line for each, as needed\.

### <a id="_Toc155184163"></a>Benefit Assessment

The benefit assessment should be written from the perspective of an individual participant\. This section should describe any physical, psychological, social, legal or any other benefits \(immediate and/or long\-term\) to an individual participant as a result of participating in the study\.

Benefits to society in general may also be included but should be discussed separately\.

Benefit considerations may include:

- Potential benefit of receiving investigational intervention during study duration that may have clinical utility \(if applicable\)
- Contributing to the process of developing new therapies in an area of unmet need – this may be particularly relevant for Clinical Pharmacology studies
- Provision of nondrug therapy \(eg, compression stockings\) if applicable
- Medical evaluations/assessments associated with study procedures \(eg, physical exam, ECG, labs, etc\)

Guidelines regarding payment to participants vary by region and country\. Because payments cannot be considered a benefit, do not include discussion of payment \(whether as an inducement to participate or as compensation for time and inconvenience to participants\) in this analysis\. For this assessment, provision of incidental care should also not be considered a benefit\.

### <a id="_Toc155184164"></a>Overall Benefit Risk Conclusion

Provide a succinct concluding statement on the perceived balance between risks that have been identified from cumulative safety data, protocol procedures and anticipated efficacy/benefits within the context of the proposed study\. Risks need to be weighed against the benefits for the __individual participant\.__

Clinical studies should generally pose only minimal risks to incapacitated participants, minors, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and clinical studies conducted in emergency situations\. Refer to local guidelines for specific requirements or benefit/risk thresholds in these populations and ensure that these are addressed here, if applicable\.

Outcomes of discussions with regulatory authorities as related to benefit/risk and reporting may be summarized here if it provides useful insights for the investigator\.

# <a id="_Toc155184165"></a>Objectives, Endpoints, and Estimands

- The protocol is the primary source of information for protocol endpoint registration on public registers \(eg, ClinicalTrials\.gov\)\.
- *Objectives*:
- Objectives and endpoints for specific therapeutic areas may be accessed in the therapeutic area libraries\. List each scientific objective of the study, clearly and concisely, differentiating between primary, secondary, and tertiary \(or other/exploratory\) objectives\. The objectives should present the questions that the study is designed to answer \(which can include predefined safety parameters\)\. Secondary objectives should not merely reiterate the secondary endpoints of the study\.
- State specific PRO objectives\. Specify the PRO concepts/domains used to evaluate the intervention \(eg, overall health\-related quality of life, specific domain, specific symptom\) and, for each one, the analysis metric \(eg, change from baseline, final value, time to event\) and the principal timepoint or period of interest\.
- The objectives should be stated with sufficient specificity that the reader can easily understand the intended context \(eg, Superiority of \[intervention X\] vs control when the intervention is taken as directed\)\. Consultation or review by a statistician is recommended\.
- *Endpoints:*
- An endpoint is defined in draft ICH E8\(R1\) as a “subject\-level attribute of interest”, so ensure wordings like “proportion of participants reaching \[target\]” are not used, but rather “Participant reaching \[target\] \(yes/no\)” when defining endpoints\.
- Ensure that there is an endpoint with associated timepoint or timeframe for each study objective including exploratory objectives, if applicable, and that there are no endpoints without a corresponding objective\.
- Be specific and selective when choosing and describing primary and secondary endpoints because results for all primary and secondary endpoints are required to be listed on the ClinicalTrials\.gov website and other public registers\. 
- In a study designed to establish efficacy, a primary endpoint should measure a clinically meaningful therapeutic effect or be a surrogate or other endpoint with a demonstrated ability to predict clinical benefit\.
- Avoid vague descriptions of primary and secondary endpoints that encapsulate a large number of measures and timepoints, such as “safety and tolerability as determined by AE reporting, laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs\.” In a typical clinical study this could equate to hundreds of endpoints, all of which must be registered on ClinicalTrials\.gov and other public registers\. Consider including such general objectives and endpoints in the Tertiary/Exploratory/Other section, which will not be registered on public registers\.
- If there is a safety measure of special relevance, this can be included as a specific primary or secondary endpoint \(eg, a specific lab measurement or an adverse event of special interest\)\.
- It is recommended not to include study procedures as an endpoint; only the data resulting from the procedure should be an endpoint\. For example, abnormal physical examination should not be designated as an endpoint unless it is clear where this endpoint is captured and how it will be summarized in the clinical study report\. Details of procedures should be placed in Section 8 Study Assessments and Procedures\. Consider whether the desired endpoints will be achievable in case of unexpected findings, technical/equipment issues, or personnel failure\.
- If a clinical outcome assessment \(COA\) is included in the study, mention the concept being measured \(eg, fatigue\) as well as the instrument \(eg, fatigue as measured by the fatigue scale in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\-Anemia \[FACT\-An\]\)\. Avoid the term quality of life and use a more specific term such as physical functioning or vitality\.
- If additional tertiary/exploratory/other endpoints \(eg, pharmacodynamic endpoints\) may be explored, consider addition of a general statement giving an indication of the types of endpoints that might be explored\. For example, in cardiovascular studies, a statement such as “Additional atherosclerotic biomarkers may be explored” may be appropriate\. The study procedures section of the protocol should clarify, to the extent possible, how and when the additional endpoints will be selected, the types of endpoints that may be assayed \(eg, protein, messenger ribonucleic acid\), whether existing or additional samples would be used for these assays, and how any changes to exploratory endpoints will be documented\.
- Identify surrogate markers if used as study endpoints\.
- *Estimands:*
- It is recommended that objectives and endpoints be presented together in a table \(see example\) to ensure all endpoints are aligned with an objective\. Further, it is recommended to include the definition\(s\) of the estimands below the table\. 
- Estimands include 5 attributes: the treatment condition of interest, the population, variable \(or endpoint\), details of how to account for intercurrent events \(ICEs\), and the population\-level summary for the variable\.
- The ICH E9\(R1\) addendum tries to distinguish the development of the estimand, ie, the treatment effect of interest, and the conduct of a study for estimation\. While in practice the estimand is defined in order to plan a study, ideally it should be possible to communicate the estimand without reference to study specific context\. For example, the population should reflect the set of patients or individuals targeted by the clinical question, represented by the study population\. Describing the population, the appropriate term “patients” or “individuals” should be used instead of referring to study participants\. The same is true for the treatment conditions: the test intervention and the control to which comparison\(s\) will be made should be mentioned, giving the name of the specific intervention, but not simply referring to “study” intervention\.
- The estimands should be clear and include sufficient detail on each attribute\. 
- Estimands are mandatory for confirmatory studies \(ie, studies in which pre\-specified hypotheses are evaluated, see ICH E9\), but it is also strongly recommended to include estimands in other types of studies\.
- Define one or more estimands for the primary and key secondary objectives\. An estimand description is not required for tertiary/exploratory objectives\. 
- Include the clinical question\(s\) of interest that drives the estimand\(s\) and provide a rationale for the chosen estimand\(s\), eg, per regulatory guidance or per clinical justification such as estimating the treatment effect without the confounding effect of rescue intervention or the treatment effect including the effect of rescue medication to reflect clinical practice\. Make sure to address all ICEs and all other attributes of the estimand and justify accordingly\.
- If including more than one estimand for the primary objective, one of them should be named primary\. 
- If for a particular study different primary estimands/endpoints are required for different regulatory authorities, it should be specified which one is considered primary for each regulatory authority\.
- Indicate not applicable or remove the section if no estimand is defined for the study\.
- For complex trials, the master protocol should have an overarching scientific hypothesis and the primary objective should not be changed during the conduct of the trial\.

Estimand\(s\) for Primary Objective\(s\)

Estimands for Secondary Objective\(s\)

Secondary and supplementary estimands should be defined for each secondary objective as relevant\.

Estimands for \[Tertiary/Exploratory/Other\] Objectives

Tertiary/Exploratory/Other and supplementary estimands should be defined for each Tertiary/Exploratory/Other objective as relevant\.

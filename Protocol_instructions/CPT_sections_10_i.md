Do not use this appendix to create extensive lists of country\-specific differences\. Protocol requirements and specifications outlined in the body of the protocol should be authored using flexible language to accommodate local variation where permissible and within the parameters of the study design; this appendix should be used for requirements that cannot be addressed by flexible language\.

Discuss with local regulatory groups whether country specific requirements need to be included in the appendix\. The country\-specific appendix may include a list \(by country\) of country\-specific requirements in order that any requirements for a given country can be seen in one location\.

Country\-specific requirements listed in the appendix should also be clearly cross\-referenced within the body of the document, within the sections they refer to, but details should not be included\. 

Countries where contraception requirements may differ: Australia, Japan

Korea: Local sponsor should be identified in addition to company sponsor on protocol agreement page\.

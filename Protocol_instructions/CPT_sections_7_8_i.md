- Specify if the study allows for standard\-of\-care procedures as baseline assessments\.
- For medical devices, provide a summary of the necessary training and experience needed to use the device\.
- All COA parameters should be fully integrated into the appropriate sections of the protocol\. 
- COA is an umbrella term encompassing different types of outcomes:
	- Patient\-reported outcome \(PRO\) measures – reported directly from the participant without interpretation by a clinician or anybody else
	- Clinician\-reported outcome \(ClinRO\) measures
	- Observer\-reported outcome \(ObsRO\) measures
	- Performance outcome \(PerfO\) measures 
- If COA measures are used, include instructions for the investigators regarding the following:
	- Training and instructions provided to participants related to completing the questionnaires
	- Participant supervision during COA administration
	- Processes and rules for questionnaire review for completeness
	- Documentation of how and when data are filed, stored, and transmitted to or from the study site should be noted in the protocol or provided in a separate document\. 
- If PRO measures are used, include the following information:
	- Specify the PRO concepts/domains used to evaluate the intervention \(eg, overall health\-related quality of life, specific domain, specific symptom\) and, for each one, the analysis metric \(eg, change from baseline, final value, time to event\) and the principal timepoint or period of interest\.

- List and describe administrative and general/baseline procedures outlined in the SoA that are not described in the subsequent sections \(eg, medical history\)\. 

## <a id="_Toc155184205"></a>\[Efficacy and/or Immunogenicity\] Assessments

- Clearly list and define the specific measurements and assessments \(including tools, equipment, instruments/questionnaires, laboratory tests, etc, with calibration methods if appropriate\) that will be used for assessing and recording the efficacy data\.
- The results of each primary and secondary outcome measure are required to be reported in the CT Registry; therefore, each measure and associated visits at which it will be evaluated should be clearly identified \(visits should be captured in the SoA\)\. For each measure, give the reference \(where possible\) and describe how scoring will be accomplished\.
- Instructions or protocols for specialized tests may be presented in an appendix; however, do not use copies of case report forms \(CRFs\), published questionnaires, or rating scales as an appendix, as these will need to be redacted before disclosure\. Any of these documents used in the study should be included in the CRF or annotated CRF with those not owned by the sponsor in a separate section for ease of redaction\.
	- If any scale/questions are to be included in an appendix, it should be representative of what will be used in the CRF as it may change prior to study initiation or throughout the study\. Consider including the following language in this section to address this circumstance, “Appendix \[X\] provides a representative example of the \[scale\] \[questions\] \[specify other\] that will be used in this study”\.  
- Any definitions used to characterize outcomes \(eg, criteria for determining occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, designation of the location of the infarction, characterization of a stroke as thrombotic or hemorrhagic, distinction between transient ischemic attack and stroke, assignment of cause of death\) should be explained in full\.
- If categorical responses \(global scales, severity scores, responses of a certain size\) will be used in analyzing responses, they should be clearly defined\.

## <a id="_Toc421709273"></a><a id="_Toc477961624"></a><a id="_Toc155184206"></a>Safety Assessments

For each safety assessment:

- Specify how to perform, collect, and record each assessment \(including tools, equipment, instruments/questionnaires, laboratory tests, etc, with calibration methods if appropriate\); any limitations on personnel performing the assessment \(eg, qualifications and training needed to conduct/interpret assessments, if an attempt should be made for the same individual to conduct that assessment throughout the study\); and any definitions used to characterize outcomes\.
- Specify methods used to standardize and/or interpret the assessment \(eg, use of central laboratory, Holter monitoring, central ECG reader\)\. Details can be provided in a separate document if they do not impact participant safety\.
- Identify any noninvestigator party responsible for evaluation of laboratory or other safety assessments \(eg, sponsor or external independent data monitoring committee\) and describe any procedures used, including centralized reading/measurement\.
- Include any questionnaires and rating scales used to classify laboratory or other safety assessments\. Cross\-reference Section 7 if linked with stopping criteria\. Use validated scales\. Reference the publication of the validation of the scale\.
- Instructions or protocols for specialized tests may be presented in an appendix; however, do not use copies of CRFs, published questionnaires, or rating scales as an appendix, as these will need to be redacted before disclosure\. Any of these documents used in the study should be included in the CRF or annotated CRF with those not owned by the sponsor in a separate section for ease of redaction\.
	- If any scale/questions are to be included in an appendix, it should be representative of what will be used in the CRF as it may change prior to study initiation or throughout the study\. Consider including the following language in this section to address this circumstance, “Appendix \[X\] provides a representative example of the \[scale\] \[questions\] \[specify other\] that will be used in this study”\.  
- Include guidelines for the management of relevant laboratory or other safety assessment abnormalities\.
- Carefully evaluate inclusion/exclusion and withdrawal criteria to ensure any assessments required are included in the list of required tests\. For example, Child\-Pugh assessment requires measurement of albumin for calculation; thus, albumin needs to be included in the clinical chemistry parameters\.
- Pregnancy testing and ECG monitoring should be included in safety evaluations regardless of whether they are collected only at baseline to determine eligibility or if they are repeated throughout the study\.

### <a id="_Toc421709274"></a><a id="_Toc477961625"></a><a id="_Toc155184207"></a>Physical Examinations

- Consider further specifications \(eg, for height and weight measurements, the participant is allowed to wear indoor, daytime clothing with no shoes\) if appropriate for the study\.
- Include special instructions for assessing weight changes that may require dose adjustments\. If the dose will be adjusted based on weight, provide details in Section 6 Study Intervention\(s\) and Concomitant Therapy\.

### <a id="_Toc421709275"></a><a id="_Toc477961626"></a><a id="_Toc155184208"></a>Vital Signs

- Carefully consider which vital signs \(if any\) should be measured to ensure that only essential data are collected\.
- Include any specific instructions with respect to the collection and interpretation of vital signs\. If orthostatic vital signs will be assessed, include instructions for supine and standing blood pressure and pulse measurements\.
- Select the standard methods of vital sign collection as appropriate for the countries in which the study will be conducted\.
- For studies requiring sensitive blood pressure monitoring \(eg, if blood pressure decrease or increase is an anticipated effect\), include details on device calibration requirements or frequency of measuring\.

### <a id="_Toc421709276"></a><a id="_Toc477961627"></a><a id="_Toc155184209"></a>Electrocardiograms

- Specify if the ECG is for screening purposes only\.
- Include any specific instructions for the collection and interpretation of ECGs \(eg, time points relative to dosing with study intervention or other evaluations\)\.
- Indicate whether single or triplicate ECGs will be collected at each time point\. If triplicate ECGs will be collected, provide necessary details\.
- If ECGs will be analyzed at a central laboratory, instructions for the collection \(eg, equipment\), transmission, and archiving of ECG data should be agreed upon with the central laboratory and summarized\. The turnaround time for safety alerts from the central laboratory to the study site should be specified\.
- If ECGs will be read locally, indicate if digital ECG waveforms will be centrally archived and in what format\. If the digital waveforms will be archived, there is no need to retrieve paper ECGs from the study sites\.
- Include instructions with respect to local review of ECG tracings for safety findings, even if ECGs will be analyzed at a central laboratory, and any actions to be taken in response to ECG findings\.
- Consider consultation with the relevant sponsor cardiovascular safety committee\.
- High\-quality ECG data should be collected if the goal is to assess the effects of study intervention on ECG intervals such as the QT interval\. Such ECG data may be required to meet regulatory authority expectations for a thorough ECG assessment \(eg, as outlined in ICH E14\) or to better assess a cardiac conduction signal from previous nonclinical or clinical studies\. High‑quality ECGs are typically performed more frequently and in a more rigorous and more standardized fashion than routine ECGs\. High\-quality ECGs are typically recorded and archived in digital format using a central ECG vendor and analyzed by a specialized central laboratory\.
- The frequency and timing of high\-quality ECGs should reflect the PK of the study intervention and any metabolites\. In general, ECGs should be conducted around key PK timepoints including the following: predose, maximum observed concentration \(Cmax\) after the first dose, and steady‑state Cmax\. Additional measurements should be performed to account for potential PK differences between participants, unanticipated drug metabolites, delays between peak plasma/serum and tissue concentrations, and a PK lag effect\. When possible, time\-matched measurements should be considered \(eg, collection of predose and postdose ECGs at a similar time of day\) to minimize the effects of diurnal variation in ECG intervals\.
- If high\-quality ECG data are not collected in the study, ECG data must still be collected for routine safety monitoring of participants, at least until important study intervention effects on cardiac conduction or cardiac function have been sufficiently excluded in clinical studies\. For studies investigating long\-term dosing, ECGs should be obtained throughout the course of the study \(eg, after each cycle of study intervention or monthly\) as well as at the completion of the study\.
- Ensure the correction formula listed here is consistent with that listed in the QTc exclusion and withdrawal criteria\. 
- Include the second bullet of suggested text if triplicate ECGs are to be obtained\.

### <a id="_Toc421709277"></a><a id="_Toc477961628"></a><a id="_Toc155184210"></a>Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests

- For multicenter studies in participants who are patients, make every effort to ensure routine laboratory safety tests are performed by a central laboratory\. If local laboratory tests are required, these must be stated clearly in the protocol\. Provisions should be in place to allow for the acceptance of local laboratory data \(even if a central laboratory is used\)\. Sponsor databases should be set up appropriately for the reporting of data from both central and local laboratories\. Consult with the data management representative for language to be included on how data should be reported to the sponsor if a local laboratory is used\.
- Specify if the use of local laboratories is allowed in cases where initiation of study intervention or safety follow\-up is time sensitive and the central laboratory results will not be available before the need to begin study intervention or other actions that need to be taken for safety reasons\. 
- Specify any special instructions for screening samples\.
- Specify which laboratory parameters should be included in each panel \(eg, for hematology, chemistry, urinalysis\)\. List only those that will be analyzed for the study\. Confirm lists and blood volumes before finalizing the protocol\.
- See therapeutic area libraries for additional guidance\.

### <a id="_Toc16163376"></a><a id="_Toc155184211"></a>Pregnancy Testing

- Include the defined timepoints for pregnancy testing in CBP participants in the SoA\. Timepoints should be based upon a risk assessment of the potential for genotoxicity and teratogenicity/fetotoxicity of the intervention\(s\) in the study\. Risk should be determined for each intervention with input from the company’s nonclinical safety assessment group\. Determination of risk for a marketed compound should also consider the risks outlined in the product label\. Further guidance can be found in International Council for Harmonization \[ICH\] Guideline M3\(R2\) and Clinical Trial Facilitation Group \(CTFG\)\. At a minimum, a pregnancy test should be performed at screening and at the end of relevant systemic exposure to confirm pregnancy status\. Additional testing may be required between the screening visit and the first dose of study intervention on Day 1\. Consider additional pregnancy testing if the interval is:
	- ≤ 4 days, a repeat highly sensitive serum pregnancy test usually is not required
	- > 4 days, a repeat serum pregnancy test should be obtained
- For studies that have requirements for multiple pregnancy tests, add additional criteria as needed \(eg, if there is a requirement for a test to be performed within a proximal timeframe prior to first dose, specify as inclusion criteria; if at a specified visit, or at the end of study intervention, note in the SoA and provide any necessary details here\)\.
- A serum pregnancy test may diagnose pregnancy ~6 to 10 days after fertilization; a urine pregnancy test, because it is less sensitive, will diagnose pregnancy a few days after a serum pregnancy test\. As serum pregnancy tests have a lower detection limit and will detect pregnancy closer to the date of conception, serum testing is the preferred test if there is a requirement to know pregnancy status within a few days of the first dose of study intervention\.
- Decide if local or central testing will be standard for the protocol\. Highly sensitive serum testing is mandatory if required by local regulations or the IRB/IEC, or to resolve an indeterminate test or confirm a positive urine test\.
- Consider adding a generic sentence to the protocol that additional pregnancy tests will be conducted if required by local regulations\.

Clinical studies meeting either of the following 2 criteria must include appropriate assessments \(eg, Columbia\-Suicide Severity Rating Scale \[C\-SSRS\]\) to enable the prospective monitoring of suicidal ideation and behavior \(SIB\) in individual participants:

1\. Patient or healthy volunteer studies using compounds that: 

- are known to be active in the human central nervous system \(CNS\), or 
- are being studied for CNS activity, or 
- are being developed for any psychiatric or neurologic indication, or 
- may affect mood, cognition, or behavior via their effects on the CNS \(directly or indirectly\), or 
- are pharmacologically similar to medicines that have had SIB reported in association with their use, which is considered to be at least possibly causally associated \(eg, isotretinoin and other tretinoins, beta blockers, reserpine, smoking cessation medicines and medicines for weight loss\)\.

2\. Studies including any participant population with an elevated risk of SIB, which may manifest during the study, and for which monitoring of SIB is considered to be in the best interest of participant safety and/or science\.

Notes:

- Determination and documentation is made at a program level on a company\-specific basis according to their practices\. Assessment of SIB is difficult in participants with cognitive impairment of a degree that interferes with understanding of the concept of suicide \(eg, Alzheimer’s disease, other dementias, learning disability, autism\), and in participants who are terminally/critically ill\. It is therefore reasonable to omit in these circumstances\. If omission of SIB assessment is being considered for studies in challenging populations that would otherwise meet the criteria for monitoring, regulatory authority approval should be sought prior to protocol approval\.
- Young children may not have reached sufficient cognitive maturity to understand the concept of death\. As there is also no validated instrument for the prospective monitoring of SIB in children less than 7 years of age, all proposed studies in children less than 7 years that meet the criteria for monitoring of SIB should therefore be referred for regulatory and company’s internal review/advisory board for approval prior to protocol approval\. 
- It should be recognized that in uncontrolled studies, scientific interpretation of the results of monitoring of SIB may be difficult or impossible\. Even so, if monitoring is important for participant safety it may be included\.

- Insert text as appropriate for this study\. If population PK will be included, provide appropriate text\. If PK will not be part of the study, include a statement to this effect\. 
- Describe any study intervention concentrations to be measured and the sample collection times relative to dosing\. Samples of plasma, urine, or other fluids may be taken for the purpose of measuring compliance, adjusting dose, or determining if a therapeutic window exists\. This section of the protocol will be written in collaboration with the appropriate PK representatives and will contain information about sampling times, sample volume, sample handling procedures, assay methods, etc\. Specific sample collection and processing including retention time instructions can be described in an appendix and cross\-referenced\.
- Indicate definitions for the PK parameters \(eg, area under the curve \[AUC\], maximum observed concentration \[Cmax\], time to Cmax \[Tmax\], half\-life \[T½\], volume of distribution \[Vd\], clearance \[CL\]\) of interest and how they will be calculated\. Consult with the PK representative for this information\.
- Describe sampling time relative to ingestion of food, posture, and possible effects of concomitant medications/alcohol/caffeine/nicotine\.
- Describe the biological sample\(s\) collected \(blood, urine, or other such as breath, saliva, biopsies, etc\), the handling of samples, and the assay method including references to published and/or internal assay validation documentation\.
- Specify other factors that are important in assessing the PK of the study intervention \(eg, soluble circulating receptors, renal or hepatic function\) and the plan for measuring these factors\.
- Do not reiterate the details given in the SoA or other sections of the protocol\. Use cross\-references as needed\.
- If samples remaining after the pharmacokinetic analysis may be used for future exploratory research, describe here or include a separate section for future research and cross\-reference\. Describe participant consent process for use of leftover samples, the potential objective of future research and handling of future analysis \(eg, in a separate report and not the integrated CSR\)\.

- Do not include the SoA here\.
- Use bullets rather than lengthy text, if possible\.
- For studies with estimand\(s\), ensure the design is aligned to the estimand\(s\) defined in Section 3
- Include a brief summary of the study design \(eg, parallel, crossover, single group\) and control method \(eg, placebo, active comparator, low dose, historical, or none \[uncontrolled\]\), single or multicenter\. Include the kind of control group to be used, if any\.
- Include a high\-level description of the study population \(eg, healthy volunteers, patients with acute lung injury\)\.
- Level and method of blinding \(eg, open\-label, single\-blind, double\-blind, double\-blind \[sponsor unblinded\], matching placebo, double\-dummy\), and further methods to be used to minimize bias on the part of participants, investigators, and analysts\.
- Study intervention assignment method \(eg, randomization, stratification, both\)\. Do NOT state block size\. If assignment to intervention is by randomization, describe when randomization occurs relative to screening\. Do not put sample size justification here\. This is covered in Section 9 Statistical Considerations\.
- Refer to any use of an independent data monitoring committee, dose\-escalation committee, or similar review group and cross\-reference Appendix 10\.1\.6 Committees Structure\.
- Total duration of study participation for each participant with sequence and duration of study periods \(eg, screening, run\-in, fixed dose/titration, follow up/washout periods\)
- Describe any provisions for extending the study or entry to rollover studies \(cross\-reference Section 6\.7 Continued Access to Study Intervention after the End of the Study\)\. Do not duplicate information\.
- Include any plans to obtain long\-term follow\-up information regarding the participant’s safety or survival status as noted in the ICF and assent form\.
- For studies including participants of childbearing potential, include plans for collection of follow up information on maternal and fetal safety should they become pregnant during the trial\. If applicable, include cross\-reference to Section 8\.4\.5\. In addition, refer to Section 10\.8 for local follow\-up requirements, as referenced in the TransCelerate Interpretation of Pharmacovigilance Guidances & regulations Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Landscape Assessment\. 
- See therapeutic area libraries for additional guidance for studies in specific therapeutic areas\.
- A protocol deviation is related to a data point or process identified in the protocol or documents referenced in the protocol \(eg, laboratory manual\)\. When designing the study, limit items that may generate deviations whenever possible\. Reduce the number of reference documents to those essential for the conduct of the study\.

## <a id="_Toc155184168"></a>Scientific Rationale for Study Design

- Provide scientific rationale for any features of the study design and chosen control\. Include any key ethical issues\. Do not reiterate the details provided in the IB/IDFU or other documents\.
- <a id="_Hlk16256335"></a>State if design is well established or best practice including a justification for use of placebo control; adherence to regulatory convention is usually not sufficient justification\.
- Describe why the primary endpoint is clinically relevant and how it provides a reliable and valid measurement of the intended intervention effect\.
- Discuss how the primary endpoint measures direct benefit in how the participant feels, functions, or survives and what would constitute a clinically meaningful effect\.  
- If a measure of direct benefit is not proposed, describe how a proposed surrogate endpoint substitutes for how a participant feels, functions, or survives, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence to predict benefit\.
- If applicable, provide a scientific rationale that including a vulnerable study population \(eg, pediatric participants or participants requiring emergency care\) has the potential to produce a clinically relevant benefit\.
- Provide justification for the sex and age allocation of participants and if a specific sex or age group is excluded from or underrepresented in the study, an explanation of the reasons and justification for these exclusion criteria\.
- If applicable, describe the PRO\-specific research question and rationale for PRO assessment and summarize PRO findings in relevant studies\.
- If an auxiliary medicinal product \(AxMP\) or noninvestigational medicinal product \(NIMP\)/diagnostic agent to be used in the study is a marketed compound but is not used as per the approved label, a justification needs to be added in the protocol for the intervention to still be classified as an AxMP/NIMP\.
- For complex study designs:
	- Provide justification for why conducting a complex study is appropriate in the specific disease area\.  
	- What are the advantages and efficiencies gained with such a design compared to a traditional study design evaluating a single intervention?  Explain the potential rationale for effective interventions and how many interventions could be evaluated as part of the complex study\. Is there a maximum number of interventions \(overall/at any point of time\) that can be evaluated?
	- Explain what the current standard care/control arm, if applicable, is at present and under what conditions the control arm could change during the study\.

### <a id="_Toc155184169"></a>Patient Input into Design

Describe any patient involvement in the design of the clinical study and any patient suggestions implemented\. 

## <a id="_Toc395881611"></a><a id="_Toc421709238"></a><a id="_Ref449945257"></a><a id="_Toc477961596"></a><a id="_Toc155184170"></a>Justification for Dose

Provide justification for the selection of the doses of all study interventions\. Cross\-reference Section 6\.6 Dose Modification as needed\.

For a device product, state the rationale for the proposed route of administration \(eg, injection plane or technique, method of implantation\) for each study intervention and provide justification for its selection\. Consider adding the suggested text for device products\.

For first\-time in human \(FTiH\) studies, the scientific rationale for the starting dose should be briefly described\. 

If the study design foresees dose escalation, describe the maximum allowed increase from one subset to the next and mention on which data it is based \(eg, nonclinical studies\)

<a id="_Toc335643657"></a><a id="_Toc395881615"></a><a id="_Toc267565140"></a>Criteria should be numbered according to company process\.

- A selection criterion should be phrased as either inclusion or exclusion criterion \(whatever is more appropriate\), but not as both in\- and exclusion criterion\.
- As applicable, criteria for temporarily delaying enrollment, assignment to or administration of study intervention may be added to appropriate section\(s\)\.
- For complex trial designs, any inclusion/exclusion criteria provided in the master protocol apply to all sub\-protocols\. Definition of master protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria should be carefully evaluated to avoid amendments to address needs for subsequent sub\-protocols\.

- List the criteria necessary for participation in the study\. Ensure that each criterion can be easily assessed on the basis of measurable data and answered with yes/no responses\.
- When choosing inclusion criteria, consider that study participants should be representative of the patient population to which the results will be generalized\.
- The choice of the study population in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical study should reflect the intended use of the intervention\. This is particularly relevant for planning multiregional studies and for the range of subgroups that may be relevant to evaluate\. 
- If measures to enrich the study population for prespecified subgroups of interest are used, they should be described here\.
- In general, laboratory results required for eligibility should be listed as inclusion criteria rather than exclusion criteria\.
- The use of double negatives should be avoided \(eg, no indication of prior noncompliance with the intervention regimen\)\.
- As applicable, the inclusion criteria should take into consideration the medical device component for DDC products and the usability aspects for the targeted population\. 
- Specify any PRO\-specific eligibility criteria \(eg, language/reading requirements or pre‑randomization completion of PRO\)\. If PROs will not be collected in the entire study sample, provide a rationale and describe the recruitment method for obtaining the PRO subsample\.

Age

Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics

For studies in healthy volunteers, begin with this criterion\.

Weight

Consider whether any restriction on weight or BMI is needed for this study intervention/stage of development and delete if not required\.

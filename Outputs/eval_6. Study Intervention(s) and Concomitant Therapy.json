    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.8,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.80 because, while the majority of the output aligns with the input requirements for study interventions, there are a few statements that stray from the main focus. These include references to medical devices not associated with Apixaban and Dalteparin, discussions on other interventions unrelated to the core study arms, and mentions of potential transition to warfarin, which doesn't pertain directly to the primary described protocols. Despite these elements, the score is solid due to the detailed coverage of study drug specifics, dosing, and administration aligned with the input guidelines."

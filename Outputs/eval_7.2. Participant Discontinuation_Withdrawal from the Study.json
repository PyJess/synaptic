    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.82 because the response predominantly aligns with the input requirements for study protocol generation, specifically addressing key protocol details such as trial phases, objectives, and drug administration. However, the inclusion of unrelated administrative details, like sample destruction requests, detracts slightly from the overall focus, preventing a perfect score. Still, it remains highly relevant due to the majority of the content addressing essential protocol elements."

    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.67 because the output captures several relevant elements from the input, including sampling procedures and details on drugs, yet strays with statements that don't align closely with pharmacodynamics, diluting focus and relevance. However, it retains a moderate score for addressing core aspects of the intended study structure and medicinal context."

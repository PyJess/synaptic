    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.6666666666666666,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.67 because, while the output adequately addresses the primary input requirements of detailing tested drugs, study design, and objectives, it includes an irrelevant statement about information unavailability that deviates from directly contributing to the study protocol discussion. This inclusion detracts from fully addressing the input comprehensively, hence it does not warrant a higher score. However, the relevant information provided aligns effectively with the majority of the study criteria and procedures, justifying the current score."

    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.70 because the response provides relevant data regarding the study protocol but includes some extraneous details. Defining Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP), discussing breastfeeding, and referencing animal fertility studies do not contribute directly to the main goals outlined in the input, such as study structure, objectives, or drug efficacy."

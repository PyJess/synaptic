    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.9,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.90 because the majority of the output directly addresses the input requirements for overdose treatment, covering study interventions, antidotes, and necessary procedures. The slight deduction is due to the mention of haemodialysis, which might not be clearly applicable or necessary in managing the specific overdose scenario described, thereby slightly impacting the overall relevance."

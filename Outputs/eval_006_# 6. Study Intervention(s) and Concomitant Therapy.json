    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.7428571428571429,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.74 because while the output successfully includes several key elements pertinent to the study intervention, such as randomization details and drug administration specifics, it fails to delve deeply into intervention-specific details. Essential factors like device storage, therapy compatibility, and detailed methodological approaches are omitted or insufficiently addressed, which brings the score down. However, the clear presentation of primary and secondary objectives ensures the score isn't significantly lower."

    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.00 because none of the output statements directly addressed the specific pharmacokinetics section instructions given in the input. Specifically, the statements included irrelevant discussions on pharmacokinetics related to patients with chronic renal insufficiency and dosing specifics irrelevant to the input requirements, leading to a complete mismatch between the input instructions and the output provided."

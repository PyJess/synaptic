    "prompt": "6.4. [Blinding, Masking]\nThese are your instructions:* Masking or another appropriate synonym may be used in place of blinding if considered more appropriate in the context of the study or study population (eg, studies involving visually impaired participants), but maintain consistent use within the protocol.\nThese are your instructions:* If study includes blinding, ensure to include details to whom the intervention is blinded for: Single-blind refers to studies in which participants are blinded to study intervention but site personnel (eg, monitors and investigators) and sponsor personnel are not. Double-blind refers to studies in which both participants and site personnel are blinded to study intervention.\nThese are your instructions:* If someone involved in conducting the study is not blinded (eg, the site pharmacist or the sponsors clinical trial material group), describe the methods used to preserve the blinding of the other personnel conducting the study.\nThese are your instructions:* Provide a description of the specific blinding procedures, if any, to be used. If blinding will not be used, include a statement to that effect.\nThese are your instructions:* Describe how any blinding will be achieved and any impact on bias/randomization.\nThese are your instructions:* Include the circumstances in which the blind will be broken for an individual or for all participants (eg, for SAEs), the procedures to be implemented to do this, and a description of who has access to participant codes. If the study allows for some investigators to remain unblinded (eg, to allow them to adjust medication), the methods of shielding other investigators should be explained.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:Type of Study\nThese are your instructions:Example text to use\nThese are your instructions:Open-label, no blinding at site level\nThese are your instructions:This is an open-label study; potential bias will be reduced by the following steps: [central randomization, adjudications].\nThese are your instructions:Open-label using central randomization via IVRS/IWRS\nThese are your instructions:This is an open-label study; however, the specific intervention to be taken by a participant will be assigned using an IVRS/IWRS. The site will contact the IVRS/IWRS prior to the start of study intervention administration for each participant. The site will record the intervention assignment on the applicable case report form, if required. Potential bias will be reduced by the following steps: [central randomization, adjudications].\nThese are your instructions:Blind break (IVRS/IWRS)\nThese are your instructions:This is a double-blind study in which [participants/care providers/investigators/outcomes assessors, etc] are blinded to study intervention. The IVRS/IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator may, at the investigators discretion, contact the sponsor to discuss the situation prior to unblinding a participants intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment for the participant. If a participants intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24hours of this occurrence. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded.\nThese are your instructions:Open-label using blinded randomization\nThese are your instructions:This is an open-label study; however, the specific intervention to be taken by a participant will be assigned using randomization envelopes. The site will receive blinded randomization envelopes that will be opened in ascending numerical order immediately prior to the start of study intervention administration for each participant. The site will record the date and time the envelope was opened.\nThese are your instructions:Note for open label: This is not an approach to be supported from a statistical perspective. Open-label randomized studies need to use central randomization. If envelopes are preassigned to the site, the randomization must be blocked at the site level, which introduces selection bias risk whether or not the randomization codes are blinded in envelopes.\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:Blind break (envelopes)\nThese are your instructions:This is a double-blind study in which [participants/care providers/investigators/outcomes assessors, etc] are blinded to study intervention. A sealed envelope that contains the study intervention assignment for each participant will be provided to the investigator. The sealed envelope will be retained by the investigator (or representative) in a secured area. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator may, at the investigators discretion, contact the sponsor to discuss the situation prior to unblinding a participants intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment for the participant. If a participants intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of this occurrence. Once the study is complete, all envelopes (sealed and opened) must be inventoried and returned to the sponsor.\nThese are your instructions:Blinded study with unblinded third party who is dispensing intervention\nThese are your instructions:Participants will be randomly assigned in a [1:1] ratio to receive study intervention. Investigators will remain blinded to each participants assigned study intervention throughout the course of the study. To maintain this blind, an otherwise uninvolved third party will be responsible for the reconstitution and dispensation of all study intervention and will endeavor to ensure that there are no differences in time taken to dispense following randomization.\nThese are your instructions:This third party will instruct the [participant/participants parent(s) or legally authorized representative] to avoid discussing the taste, dosing frequency, or packaging of the study intervention with the investigator.\nThese are your instructions:In the event of a quality assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been conducted accurately.\nThese are your instructions:Sponsor safety staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participants intervention assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or sponsor policy. \nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>MANDATORY SPONSOR INPUTS FOR STUDY PROTOCOL GENERATION\nSponsor Name FADOI /BMS/PFIZER\nStudy Acronym (if available):  CARAVAGGIO Study\nTested IMP :Apixaban\nComparative drug: Dalteparin\nStudy Type Interventional\nSe Study Type = Interventional:\nInterventional Study Phase Phase IIIb\nStudy Design International, multicenter, Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE), where both patients and investigators are aware of the treatment assignments, but the outcome assessment is blindedactive-controlled, event-driven, Phase IIIB clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of Apixaban to the SOC Dalteparin in for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess whether oral apixaban is non-inferior to the subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer.\nTarget Disease: VTE (DVT/PE) in cancer patients\nType of Randomization: Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis (permuted blocks of four) to receive either apixaban or dalteparin in an open-label fashion.\nRandomization should be centralized and stratified by:\n1) symptomatic vs. unsuspected VTE\n2) active cancer vs. history of cancer\nTested drugs and dosages \nApixaban group: orally administered, at the dose of 10 mg bid for 7 days, followed by 5 mg bid (total period of treatment: six months)\nDalteparin group: subcutaneously administered, at a dose of 200 IU/kg SC o.i.d for 1 month.

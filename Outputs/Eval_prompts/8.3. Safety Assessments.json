    "prompt": "8.3. Safety Assessments\nThese are your instructions:For each safety assessment:\nThese are your instructions:* Specify how to perform, collect, and record each assessment (including tools, equipment, instruments/questionnaires, laboratory tests, etc, with calibration methods if appropriate); any limitations on personnel performing the assessment (eg, qualifications and training needed to conduct/interpret assessments, if an attempt should be made for the same individual to conduct that assessment throughout the study); and any definitions used to characterize outcomes.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify methods used to standardize and/or interpret the assessment (eg, use of central laboratory, Holter monitoring, central ECG reader). Details can be provided in a separate document if they do not impact participant safety.\nThese are your instructions:* Identify any noninvestigator party responsible for evaluation of laboratory or other safety assessments (eg, sponsor or external independent data monitoring committee) and describe any procedures used, including centralized reading/measurement.\nThese are your instructions:* Include any questionnaires and rating scales used to classify laboratory or other safety assessments. Cross-reference Section 7 if linked with stopping criteria. Use validated scales. Reference the publication of the validation of the scale.\nThese are your instructions:* Instructions or protocols for specialized tests may be presented in an appendix; however, do not use copies of CRFs, published questionnaires, or rating scales as an appendix, as these will need to be redacted before disclosure. Any of these documents used in the study should be included in the CRF or annotated CRF with those not owned by the sponsor in a separate section for ease of redaction.\nThese are your instructions:o If any scale/questions are to be included in an appendix, it should be representative of what will be used in the CRF as it may change prior to study initiation or throughout the study. Consider including the following language in this section to address this circumstance, Appendix [X] provides a representative example of the [scale] [questions] [specify other] that will be used in this study.  \nThese are your instructions:* Include guidelines for the management of relevant laboratory or other safety assessment abnormalities.\nThese are your instructions:* Carefully evaluate inclusion/exclusion and withdrawal criteria to ensure any assessments required are included in the list of required tests. For example, Child-Pugh assessment requires measurement of albumin for calculation; thus, albumin needs to be included in the clinical chemistry parameters.\nThese are your instructions:* Pregnancy testing and ECG monitoring should be included in safety evaluations regardless of whether they are collected only at baseline to determine eligibility or if they are repeated throughout the study.\nThese are your instructions:8.3.1. Physical Examinations\nThese are your instructions:* Consider further specifications (eg, for height and weight measurements, the participant is allowed to wear indoor, daytime clothing with no shoes) if appropriate for the study.\nThese are your instructions:* Include special instructions for assessing weight changes that may require dose adjustments. If the dose will be adjusted based on weight, provide details in Section 6 Study Intervention(s) and Concomitant Therapy.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:* A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the [cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological] systems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded.\nThese are your instructions:* A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the [skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen)].\nThese are your instructions:* Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.\nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>\nThese are your instructions:8.3.2. Vital Signs\nThese are your instructions:* Carefully consider which vital signs (if any) should be measured to ensure that only essential data are collected.\nThese are your instructions:* Include any specific instructions with respect to the collection and interpretation of vital signs. If orthostatic vital signs will be assessed, include instructions for supine and standing blood pressure and pulse measurements.\nThese are your instructions:* Select the standard methods of vital sign collection as appropriate for the countries in which the study will be conducted.\nThese are your instructions:* For studies requiring sensitive blood pressure monitoring (eg, if blood pressure decrease or increase is an anticipated effect), include details on device calibration requirements or frequency of measuring.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:* [Oral] [Tympanic] [Rectal] [Axillary] [Skin] [Temporal artery] temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure will be recorded (before blood collection for laboratory tests).\nThese are your instructions:* Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed [specify participants position, if applicable] with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available.\nThese are your instructions:* Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones).\nThese are your instructions:* For blood pressure measurements, 3 consecutive blood pressure readings will be recorded at intervals of at least 1minute. The average of the 3 blood pressure readings will be recorded.\nThese are your instructions:OR\nThese are your instructions:* Vital signs will be measured in a [specify participants position, if applicable] position after 5minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse [and respiratory rate]. [Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken. The first reading should be rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded.]\nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>\nThese are your instructions:8.3.3. Electrocardiograms\nThese are your instructions:* Specify if the ECG is for screening purposes only.\nThese are your instructions:* Include any specific instructions for the collection and interpretation of ECGs (eg,time points relative to dosing with study intervention or other evaluations).\nThese are your instructions:* Indicate whether single or triplicate ECGs will be collected at each time point. If triplicate ECGs will be collected, provide necessary details.\nThese are your instructions:* If ECGs will be analyzed at a central laboratory, instructions for the collection (eg,equipment), transmission, and archiving of ECG data should be agreed upon with the central laboratory and summarized. The turnaround time for safety alerts from the central laboratory to the study site should be specified.\nThese are your instructions:* If ECGs will be read locally, indicate if digital ECG waveforms will be centrally archived and in what format. If the digital waveforms will be archived, there is no need to retrieve paper ECGs from the study sites.\nThese are your instructions:* Include instructions with respect to local review of ECG tracings for safety findings, even if ECGs will be analyzed at a central laboratory, and any actions to be taken in response to ECG findings.\nThese are your instructions:* Consider consultation with the relevant sponsor cardiovascular safety committee.\nThese are your instructions:* High-quality ECG data should be collected if the goal is to assess the effects of study intervention on ECG intervals such as the QT interval. Such ECG data may be required to meet regulatory authority expectations for a thorough ECG assessment (eg, as outlined in ICH E14) or to better assess a cardiac conduction signal from previous nonclinical or clinical studies. High\u001equality ECGs are typically performed more frequently and in a more rigorous and more standardized fashion than routine ECGs. High-quality ECGs are typically recorded and archived in digital format using a central ECG vendor and analyzed by a specialized central laboratory.\nThese are your instructions:* The frequency and timing of high-quality ECGs should reflect the PK of the study intervention and any metabolites. In general, ECGs should be conducted around key PK timepoints including the following: predose, maximum observed concentration (Cmax) after the first dose, and steady\u001estate Cmax. Additional measurements should be performed to account for potential PK differences between participants, unanticipated drug metabolites, delays between peak plasma/serum and tissue concentrations, and a PK lag effect. When possible, time-matched measurements should be considered (eg, collection of predose and postdose ECGs at a similar time of day) to minimize the effects of diurnal variation in ECG intervals.\nThese are your instructions:* If high-quality ECG data are not collected in the study, ECG data must still be collected for routine safety monitoring of participants, at least until important study intervention effects on cardiac conduction or cardiac function have been sufficiently excluded in clinical studies. For studies investigating long-term dosing, ECGs should be obtained throughout the course of the study (eg, after each cycle of study intervention or monthly) as well as at the completion of the study.\nThese are your instructions:* Ensure the correction formula listed here is consistent with that listed in the QTc exclusion and withdrawal criteria. \nThese are your instructions:* Include the second bullet of suggested text if triplicate ECGs are to be obtained.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:* [Triplicate OR Single] 12-lead ECG(s) will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and [QTc] intervals. Refer to Section 7.1.2 for [QTc] withdrawal criteria and any additional [QTc] readings that may be necessary.\nThese are your instructions:* [At each timepoint at which triplicate ECGs are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart.]\nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>\nThese are your instructions:8.3.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests\nThese are your instructions:* For multicenter studies in participants who are patients, make every effort to ensure routine laboratory safety tests are performed by a central laboratory. If local laboratory tests are required, these must be stated clearly in the protocol. Provisions should be in place to allow for the acceptance of local laboratory data (even if a central laboratory is used). Sponsor databases should be set up appropriately for the reporting of data from both central and local laboratories. Consult with the data management representative for language to be included on how data should be reported to the sponsor if a local laboratory is used.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify if the use of local laboratories is allowed in cases where initiation of study intervention or safety follow-up is time sensitive and the central laboratory results will not be available before the need to begin study intervention or other actions that need to be taken for safety reasons. \nThese are your instructions:* Specify any special instructions for screening samples.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify which laboratory parameters should be included in each panel (eg, for hematology, chemistry, urinalysis). List only those that will be analyzed for the study. Confirm lists and blood volumes before finalizing the protocol.\nThese are your instructions:* See therapeutic area libraries for additional guidance.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of common text>\nThese are your instructions:* See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA (Section 1.3) for the timing and frequency.\nThese are your instructions:* The investigator must review the laboratory results, document this review, and record any clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The laboratory results must be retained with source documents. \nThese are your instructions:* [Abnormal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease are not considered clinically significant unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participants condition].\nThese are your instructions:* All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within [insert timeframe] after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor.\nThese are your instructions:o [If clinically significant/any] values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the sponsor notified.\nThese are your instructions:o All protocol-required laboratory tests, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 1.3).\nThese are your instructions:o If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory tests performed at the institutions local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded.\nThese are your instructions:<End of common text>\nThese are your instructions:8.3.5. Pregnancy Testing\nThese are your instructions:* Include the defined timepoints for pregnancy testing in CBP participants in the SoA. Timepoints should be based upon a risk assessment of the potential for genotoxicity and teratogenicity/fetotoxicity of the intervention(s) in the study. Risk should be determined for each intervention with input from the companys nonclinical safety assessment group. Determination of risk for a marketed compound should also consider the risks outlined in the product label. Further guidance can be found in International Council for Harmonization [ICH] Guideline M3(R2) and Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG). At a minimum, a pregnancy test should be performed at screening and at the end of relevant systemic exposure to confirm pregnancy status. Additional testing may be required between the screening visit and the first dose of study intervention on Day 1. Consider additional pregnancy testing if the interval is:\nThese are your instructions:o ? 4 days, a repeat highly sensitive serum pregnancy test usually is not required\nThese are your instructions:o > 4 days, a repeat serum pregnancy test should be obtained\nThese are your instructions:* For studies that have requirements for multiple pregnancy tests, add additional criteria as needed (eg, if there is a requirement for a test to be performed within a proximal timeframe prior to first dose, specify as inclusion criteria; if at a specified visit, or at the end of study intervention, note in the SoA and provide any necessary details here).\nThese are your instructions:* A serum pregnancy test may diagnose pregnancy ~6 to 10 days after fertilization; a urine pregnancy test, because it is less sensitive, will diagnose pregnancy a few days after a serum pregnancy test. As serum pregnancy tests have a lower detection limit and will detect pregnancy closer to the date of conception, serum testing is the preferred test if there is a requirement to know pregnancy status within a few days of the first dose of study intervention.\nThese are your instructions:* Decide if local or central testing will be standard for the protocol. Highly sensitive serum testing is mandatory if required by local regulations or the IRB/IEC, or to resolve an indeterminate test or confirm a positive urine test.\nThese are your instructions:* Consider adding a generic sentence to the protocol that additional pregnancy tests will be conducted if required by local regulations.\nThese are your instructions:Insert library content here.\nThese are your instructions:8.3.6. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring\nThese are your instructions:Clinical studies meeting either of the following 2 criteria must include appropriate assessments (eg, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS]) to enable the prospective monitoring of suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) in individual participants:\nThese are your instructions:1. Patient or healthy volunteer studies using compounds that: \nThese are your instructions:* are known to be active in the human central nervous system (CNS), or \nThese are your instructions:* are being studied for CNS activity, or \nThese are your instructions:* are being developed for any psychiatric or neurologic indication, or \nThese are your instructions:* may affect mood, cognition, or behavior via their effects on the CNS (directly or indirectly), or \nThese are your instructions:* are pharmacologically similar to medicines that have had SIB reported in association with their use, which is considered to be at least possibly causally associated (eg, isotretinoin and other tretinoins, beta blockers, reserpine, smoking cessation medicines and medicines for weight loss).\nThese are your instructions:2. Studies including any participant population with an elevated risk of SIB, which may manifest during the study, and for which monitoring of SIB is considered to be in the best interest of participant safety and/or science.\nThese are your instructions:Notes:\nThese are your instructions:* Determination and documentation is made at a program level on a company-specific basis according to their practices. Assessment of SIB is difficult in participants with cognitive impairment of a degree that interferes with understanding of the concept of suicide (eg, Alzheimers disease, other dementias, learning disability, autism), and in participants who are terminally/critically ill. It is therefore reasonable to omit in these circumstances. If omission of SIB assessment is being considered for studies in challenging populations that would otherwise meet the criteria for monitoring, regulatory authority approval should be sought prior to protocol approval.\nThese are your instructions:* Young children may not have reached sufficient cognitive maturity to understand the concept of death. As there is also no validated instrument for the prospective monitoring of SIB in children less than 7 years of age, all proposed studies in children less than 7 years that meet the criteria for monitoring of SIB should therefore be referred for regulatory and companys internal review/advisory board for approval prior to protocol approval. \nThese are your instructions:* It should be recognized that in uncontrolled studies, scientific interpretation of the results of monitoring of SIB may be difficult or impossible. Even so, if monitoring is important for participant safety it may be included.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:[STUDY INTERVENTION] is considered to be a CNS-active intervention.\nThese are your instructions:AND/OR:\nThese are your instructions:[STUDY INTERVENTION] is related to products with an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior. \nThese are your instructions:AND/OR:\nThese are your instructions:Patients with [CONDITION] may occasionally develop suicidal ideation or behavior.\nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>\nThese are your instructions:<Start of common text>\nThese are your instructions:Participants being treated with [study intervention X] should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) or any other unusual changes in behavior, especially at the beginning and end of the course of intervention, or at the time of dose changes, either increases or decreases. Participants who experience signs of SIB should undergo a risk assessment. All factors contributing to SIB should be evaluated and consideration should be given to discontinuation of the study intervention. \nThese are your instructions:<End of common text>\nThese are your instructions:If study design calls for family and caregiver input, specify the need to communicate to these parties. For wording to be used in pediatric studies, see the pediatric participant library.\nThese are your instructions:Specify how, if in the event of suicidal ideation or behavior, information will be shared with the legal guardian or others, including mental health professionals (local regulations should be followed). Address in the informed consent and assent forms as appropriate.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of common text>\nThese are your instructions:When informed consent or assent has been given, families and caregivers of participants being treated with [study intervention X] should be alerted about the need to monitor participants for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior and to report such symptoms immediately to the study investigator.\nThese are your instructions:[Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior/intervention-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior] will be monitored during [study identifier] using [name of scale].\nThese are your instructions:<End of common text>\nThese are your instructions:MANDATORY SPONSOR INPUTS FOR STUDY PROTOCOL GENERATION\nSponsor Name FADOI /BMS/PFIZER\nStudy Acronym (if available):  CARAVAGGIO Study\nTested IMP :Apixaban\nComparative drug: Dalteparin\nStudy Type Interventional\nSe Study Type = Interventional:\nInterventional Study Phase Phase IIIb\nStudy Design International, multicenter, Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE), where both patients and investigators are aware of the treatment assignments, but the outcome assessment is blindedactive-controlled, event-driven, Phase IIIB clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of Apixaban to the SOC Dalteparin in for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess whether oral apixaban is non-inferior to the subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer.\nTarget Disease: VTE (DVT/PE) in cancer patients\nType of Randomization: Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis (permuted blocks of four) to receive either apixaban or dalteparin in an open-label fashion.\nRandomization should be centralized and stratified by:\n1) symptomatic vs. unsuspected VTE\n2) active cancer vs. history of cancer\nTested drugs and dosages \nApixaban group: orally administered, at the dose of 10 mg bid for 7 days, followed by 5 mg bid (total period of treatment: six months)\nDalteparin group: subcutaneously administered, at a dose of 200 IU/kg SC o.i.d for 1 month.

A clinical examination and objective tests will be performed if the patient develops symptoms or signs suggestive of recurrent VTE.\nStudy Objectives \nPrimary efficacy outcome:\nobjectively confirmed recurrent VTE occurring during the study period, that means the composite of:\n• proximal DVT of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected)\n• DVT of the upper limb (symptomatic)\n• PE (symptomatic or unsuspected)\nSecondary efficacy outcomes:\n• the individual components of the primary efficacy outcome;\n• symptomatic recurrence of VTE;\n• all cause death;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding plus all cause death;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus all cause death;\n• any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal (including acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke);\n• all venous thromboembolic events (including splanchnic vein thrombosis and cerebral vein thrombosis);\n• Quality of life (QoL) according to Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) \nSafety Study Outcomes:\nPrimary safety outcome is major bleeding, defined (as per ISTH guidelines), as acute clinically overt bleeding associated with one or more of the following:\n• decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dl (1.2 mmol/L) or more;\n• transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells;\n• bleeding that occurs in at least one critical site [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal];\n• bleeding that is fatal;\n• bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention\nSecondary safety outcomes include:\n• Clinically relevant non-major bleeding event defined as acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of:\n• any bleeding compromising hemodynamics;\n• spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, or 100 cm2 if there was a traumatic cause;\n• intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography;\n• epistaxis or gingival bleeding requiring tamponade or other medical intervention or bleeding from venipuncture for >5 minutes;\n• hematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures;\n• hemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention;\n• or any other bleeding considered to have clinical consequences for a patient such as medical intervention,\nthe need for unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, or temporary cessation of a study drug, or associated with pain or impairment of activities of daily life.\n• Clinically relevant bleeding defined as the composite of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding\n• Permanent early discontinuation of study drug due to safety reasons\nMaximum Sample Size for each arm\nLess than 600 patients for each treatment group\nRecommended Inclusion Criteria\nAge > 18 years\nBoth Genders\nSigned Informed Consent\nConsecutive patients with a newly diagnosed, objectively\nconfirmed:\n• symptomatic or unsuspected, proximal lower-limb DVT\nor\n• symptomatic PE or\n• unsuspected PE in a segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery.\nAny type of cancer (other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, primary brain tumor or known intracerebral metastases and acute leukemia) that meets at least one of the\nfollowing:\n• Active cancer defined as diagnosis of cancer within six months before the study inclusion, or receiving treatment for cancer at the time of inclusion or any treatment for cancer during 6 months prior to randomization, or recurrent locally advanced or metastatic cancer.\n• Cancer diagnosed within 2 years before the study inclusion (history of cancer).\nRecommended Exclusion Criteria\nage <18 years\nECOG Performance Status III or IV;\nlife expectancy of less than 6 months;\nrelated to anticoagulant treatment:\nadministration of therapeutic doses of LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for more than 72 hours before randomization;\n3 or more doses of a vitamin K antagonist before randomization;\nthrombectomy, vena cava filter insertion, or thrombolysis used to manage the index episode;\n indication for anticoagulant treatment for a disease other than the index VTE episode;\nconcomitant use of strong inhibitors or inducers of both cytochrome P-450 3A4 and P-Glycoprotein ;\nrelated to bleeding risk:\nconcomitant thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) or aspirin over 165 mg daily or dual antiplatelet therapy;\nactive bleeding or high risk of bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant treatment\nrecent (in the last 1 month prior to randomization) brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery\n hemoglobin level lower than 8 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L) or platelet count <75x109/L or history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia;\ncreatinine clearance < 30 ml /min based on the Cockcroft Gault equation;\nacute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis; or an alanine aminotransferase level 3 times or more and/or bilirubin level 2 times or more higher the upper limit of the normal range;\nuncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP> 180 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment);\nstandard criteria:\n bacterial endocarditis;\nhypersensitivity to the study drugs or to any of their excipients;\npatients participation in other pharmaco therapeutic program with an experimental therapy that is known to effect the coagulation system.\nwomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who do not practice a medically accepted highly effective contraception during the trial and one month beyond. Highly effective contraception methods are:\na. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\nb. progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\nc. intrauterine device (IUD)\nd. intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\ne. bilateral tubal occlusion\nf. vasectomized partner\ng. sexual abstinence ;\npregnancy, or breast feeding\nany condition that, as judged by the investigator, would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study.\n"

    "prompt": "9.1. General Considerations\nThese are your instructions:This section should describe general methods and definitions that do not need to be repeated in the subsequent sections. For example, a general statement that all investigational intervention/treatment condition comparisons for all categorical analyses will be tested using Fishers exact test does not need to be repeated for each categorical analysis described in later subsections. The same would be true for analysis of variance information and the model used. If different definitions are required for specific analyses, these should be stated in the relevant section. Suggested topics to be included in this section, if appropriate for the study, are provided. Subsections can be used, if applicable. Below example headings are given, but sections can be deleted, added, or modified as needed. If subsections are used, this section can have the section heading only, with no text required. \nThese are your instructions:* Common definitions of baseline \nThese are your instructions:* For randomized studies, describe stratification factors if applicable, and if not specified in Section4.1\nThese are your instructions:* General methods, such as handling of wrong stratification, wrong investigational intervention assignment, handling of values below lower limit of quantification, continuous variables will be summarized with min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles, etc\nThese are your instructions:* General choice of analysis sets for analyses.\nThese are your instructions:* Pooling strategies for countries/regions, sites, etc \nThese are your instructions:* Strategy for grouping study arms, eg, combining all active dose arms versus control.\nThese are your instructions:* Definition of study periods if needed.\nThese are your instructions:* Definition of which contrasts between investigational interventions/treatment conditions will be provided.\nThese are your instructions:* For studies conducted under a master protocol, include details regarding whether analyses will be conducted by combining sub-studies or within a sub-study.\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:9.1.1. [Decision Criteria/Statistical Hypotheses]\nThese are your instructions:* Decision criteria, such as nominal significance levels, 1- or 2-sided tests, and confidence interval probabilities \nThese are your instructions:* Clearly articulate the statistical hypotheses (null and alternative hypotheses), that will be the subject of statistical testing related to each key/confirmatory estimand, when applicable. It is recommended to state both the formal statistical null and alternative hypotheses and a textual non-technical description. In case no hypotheses are planned to be tested, state this in this section. \nThese are your instructions:* If Bayesian or estimation approaches (no formal hypothesis) are used, describe the decision rule or estimation method.\nThese are your instructions:* For non-inferiority tests, the non-inferiority margin should be justified.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:Example 1:\nThese are your instructions:The primary objective is to demonstrate that [test intervention] is superior to [control] in achieving [outcome] at [timepoint]. Thus, the null hypothesis to be tested in relation to the primary estimand is as follows:\nThese are your instructions:* Null hypothesis: [test intervention] is not different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome] at [timepoint].\nThese are your instructions:vs. \nThese are your instructions:* Alternative hypothesis: [test intervention] is different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome] at [timepoint].\nThese are your instructions:The null and alternative hypotheses corresponding to the secondary estimands are as follows:\nThese are your instructions:Secondary objective [1]:\nThese are your instructions:* Null hypothesis: [test intervention] is not different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome/endpoint] at [timepoint].\nThese are your instructions:* Alternative hypothesis: [test intervention] is different from [control] with respect to the achievement of [outcome] at [timepoint].\nThese are your instructions:Secondary objective [2]:\nThese are your instructions:* Null hypothesis: [test intervention] is not different from [control] with respect to change from baseline to [timepoint] in [health measurement/outcome].\nThese are your instructions:* Alternative hypothesis: [test intervention] is different from [control] with respect to change from baseline to [timepoint] in [health measurement/outcome].\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:Example 2:\nThese are your instructions:For the primary estimand with primary endpoint, change from baseline to [timepoint] in [health measurement or observation], the following 2 (confirmatory) 1-sided hypotheses are planned to be tested for [test intervention] versus [control]. Let the mean treatment difference be defined as ? = ([test intervention] minus [control]). Note that smaller values for [endpoint] are better.\nThese are your instructions:The primary aim is to show that the [test intervention] is not unacceptably worse than the existing [control], using a non-inferiority margin of [non-inferiority margin] [unit] for the difference of the means. If this is confirmed, a test for superiority will subsequently be made. \nThese are your instructions:Noninferiority (noninferiority margin is [noninferiority margin])\nThese are your instructions:H0: ? ? [noninferiority margin] against Ha: ? < [noninferiority margin]\nThese are your instructions:The rationale for the non-inferiority margin is\nThese are your instructions:Superiority\nThese are your instructions:H0: ? ? 0.0 [unit] against Ha: ? < 0.0 [unit]\nThese are your instructions:Operationally the hypotheses will be evaluated by 2-sided tests.\nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>\nThese are your instructions:9.1.2. Multiplicity Adjustment\nThese are your instructions:* Clearly state the (local and/or global) significance level, the family-wise error-rate and the method for controlling overall type I error.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:Example 1 (linked to example 1 in the statistical hypotheses):\nThese are your instructions:A closed testing procedure that controls the family wise error rate in the strong sense at the overall [5]% level will be applied. The statistical comparisons for the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary endpoints will be carried out in the hierarchical order as indicated in Section 9.1. This means that the statistical hypotheses are tested in the prespecified order at the same significance level of ?=[0.05] as long as all preceding hypotheses are rejected. Once a hypothesis is not rejected, subsequent hypotheses cannot be formally tested and therefore cannot be rejected.\nThese are your instructions:Example 2 (linked to example 2 in the statistical hypotheses):\nThese are your instructions:The type I error of ?= [5]% will be controlled in the strong sense using a hierarchical (fixed sequence) testing procedure. This is based on priority ordering of the null hypotheses and testing them in this order using the [2]-sided [95]% confidence interval approach until an insignificant result appears. Consequently, the second null hypothesis will only be tested if the first null hypothesis has been rejected in favor of [test intervention]. Operationally the hypotheses will be evaluated by 2-sided tests.\nThese are your instructions:The steps in the hierarchical testing procedure are as follows:\nThese are your instructions:Step 1: [health measurement or observation] noninferiority of [test intervention] versus [control]\nThese are your instructions:Step 2: [health measurement or observation] superiority of [test intervention] versus [control]\nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>\nThese are your instructions:9.1.3. Impact of Intercurrent Events Strategies\nThese are your instructions:* For studies with estimands,\nThese are your instructions:o Consider adding a subsection to describe the intercurrent events, their strategies, and any technical statistical implication. Alternatively, this can be described in the relevant analysis sections. \nThese are your instructions:o Describe how intercurrent events will be summarized (number by treatment condition and timing).\nThese are your instructions:9.1.4. Handling of Missing Data\nThese are your instructions:Consider adding a subsection on handling of missing data including missing baseline values if this is planned to be handled in the same way across analyses. Alternatively, this can be described in the relevant analysis sections.MANDATORY SPONSOR INPUTS FOR STUDY PROTOCOL GENERATION\nSponsor Name FADOI /BMS/PFIZER\nStudy Acronym (if available):  CARAVAGGIO Study\nTested IMP :Apixaban\nComparative drug: Dalteparin\nStudy Type Interventional\nSe Study Type = Interventional:\nInterventional Study Phase Phase IIIb\nStudy Design International, multicenter, Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE), where both patients and investigators are aware of the treatment assignments, but the outcome assessment is blindedactive-controlled, event-driven, Phase IIIB clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of Apixaban to the SOC Dalteparin in for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess whether oral apixaban is non-inferior to the subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer.\nTarget Disease: VTE (DVT/PE) in cancer patients\nType of Randomization: Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis (permuted blocks of four) to receive either apixaban or dalteparin in an open-label fashion.\nRandomization should be centralized and stratified by:\n1) symptomatic vs. unsuspected VTE\n2) active cancer vs. history of cancer\nTested drugs and dosages \nApixaban group: orally administered, at the dose of 10 mg bid for 7 days, followed by 5 mg bid (total period of treatment: six months)\nDalteparin group: subcutaneously administered, at a dose of 200 IU/kg SC o.i.d for 1 month.

    "output": "## 9.1 General Considerations\n\n## 9.1.1 Decision Criteria/Statistical Hypotheses\nThe primary objective will be to assess the non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcu\n‐\ntaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed\nproximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer\n[7, 8]. The trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority, and the primary outcome analysis will\nbe based on time-to-event data. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be cal\n‐\nculated.\nThe null and alternative hypotheses will be formulated to support this non-inferiority objective.\nNominal significance levels, confidence interval probabilities, and the use of 1- or 2-sided tests\nwill be prespecified.\nPrevious studies provide context for this non-inferiority framework. For example, the AMPLIFY\nstudy for VTE treatment showed apixaban to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/warfarin (p < 0.0001).\nThis study will be designed to test for a similar non-inferiority outcome in the specified cancer\npatient population.\nHypotheses for secondary objectives will also be defined, potentially including both non-inferior\n‐\nity  and  superiority  testing  frameworks.  The  rationale  for  the  non-inferiority  margin  and  its\noperational evaluation will be detailed.\n## 9.1.2 Multiplicity Adjustment\nTo control the overall type I error in the trial, a closed testing procedure will be implemented to\nmanage the family-wise error rate [9, 10]. Key secondary endpoints, such as major bleeding and\nall-cause death, may be tested using a pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy. This fixed\nsequence testing procedure will ensure that subsequent hypotheses are tested only if the\npreceding  ones  are  statistically  significant  at  their  prespecified  levels.  The  step-by-step\nhierarchical testing procedures and strategies for Type I error control will be fully defined.\n## 9.1.3 Impact of Intercurrent Events Strategies\nStrategies for handling intercurrent events will be defined for the analysis to ensure a robust\ninterpretation of the results.\n## 9.1.4 Handling of Missing Data\nProcedures and statistical methods for managing and imputing missing data will be prespecified\nto minimize bias in the analyses.",

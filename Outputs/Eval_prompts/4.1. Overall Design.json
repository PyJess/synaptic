The study will employ a Prospective Randomized Open\nBlinded End-point (PROBE) design, where patients and investigators will be aware of treatment\nassignments, but outcome adjudication will be performed in a blinded manner. It will be charac\n‐\nterized as a pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority, active-controlled, event-driven, randomized\ncontrolled trial.\nThe study will consist of a 6-month treatment period and will include both randomised and\npreference cohorts. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or a low-\nmolecular-weight heparin (LMWH), dalteparin. The LMWH arm will include the potential for a\ntransition to warfarin. The treatment duration for both arms will be 6 months.",

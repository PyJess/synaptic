Adverse events will be monitored with a particular focus on bleeding and clotting\nevents. Common adverse reactions expected will include haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis,\nand haematoma. The use of apixaban may be associated with an increased risk of occult or\novert bleeding from any tissue or organ, which may result in posthaemorrhagic anaemia. The\ninvestigator and any qualified designees will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and\nrecording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.\n## 8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE\n## Information\nAll SAEs and AEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the\nfinal follow-up visit at 7 months. The primary monitoring period will cover the 6-month treatment\nperiod. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining\ninformed consent will be recorded as medical history, not as AEs. All SAEs will be recorded and\nreported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed\n24 hours.\n## 8.4.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs\nCare will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non\n‐\nleading verbal questioning of the participant will be the preferred method to inquire about AE\noccurrences. Patients receiving apixaban will be carefully observed for any signs of bleeding.\nSpecific signs and symptoms of bleeding to monitor for will include bruising or bleeding under\nthe skin, tar-coloured stools, blood in urine, epistaxis, dizziness, tiredness, paleness, weakness,\nsudden severe headache, and coughing up or vomiting blood.\n## 8.4.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs\nAfter  the  initial  AE/SAE  report,  the  investigator  will  be  required  to  proactively  follow  each\nparticipant at subsequent visits/contacts.

A clinical examination and objective tests will be performed if the patient develops symptoms or signs suggestive of recurrent VTE.\nStudy Objectives \nPrimary efficacy outcome:\nobjectively confirmed recurrent VTE occurring during the study period, that means the composite of:\n• proximal DVT of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected)\n• DVT of the upper limb (symptomatic)\n• PE (symptomatic or unsuspected)\nSecondary efficacy outcomes:\n• the individual components of the primary efficacy outcome;\n• symptomatic recurrence of VTE;\n• all cause death;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding plus all cause death;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus all cause death;\n• any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal (including acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke);\n• all venous thromboembolic events (including splanchnic vein thrombosis and cerebral vein thrombosis);\n• Quality of life (QoL) according to Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) \nSafety Study Outcomes:\nPrimary safety outcome is major bleeding, defined (as per ISTH guidelines), as acute clinically overt bleeding associated with one or more of the following:\n• decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dl (1.2 mmol/L) or more;\n• transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells;\n• bleeding that occurs in at least one critical site [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal];\n• bleeding that is fatal;\n• bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention\nSecondary safety outcomes include:\n• Clinically relevant non-major bleeding event defined as acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of:\n• any bleeding compromising hemodynamics;\n• spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, or 100 cm2 if there was a traumatic cause;\n• intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography;\n• epistaxis or gingival bleeding requiring tamponade or other medical intervention or bleeding from venipuncture for >5 minutes;\n• hematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures;\n• hemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention;\n• or any other bleeding considered to have clinical consequences for a patient such as medical intervention,\nthe need for unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, or temporary cessation of a study drug, or associated with pain or impairment of activities of daily life.\n• Clinically relevant bleeding defined as the composite of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding\n• Permanent early discontinuation of study drug due to safety reasons\nMaximum Sample Size for each arm\nLess than 600 patients for each treatment group\nRecommended Inclusion Criteria\nAge > 18 years\nBoth Genders\nSigned Informed Consent\nConsecutive patients with a newly diagnosed, objectively\nconfirmed:\n• symptomatic or unsuspected, proximal lower-limb DVT\nor\n• symptomatic PE or\n• unsuspected PE in a segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery.\nAny type of cancer (other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, primary brain tumor or known intracerebral metastases and acute leukemia) that meets at least one of the\nfollowing:\n• Active cancer defined as diagnosis of cancer within six months before the study inclusion, or receiving treatment for cancer at the time of inclusion or any treatment for cancer during 6 months prior to randomization, or recurrent locally advanced or metastatic cancer.\n• Cancer diagnosed within 2 years before the study inclusion (history of cancer).\nRecommended Exclusion Criteria\nage <18 years\nECOG Performance Status III or IV;\nlife expectancy of less than 6 months;\nrelated to anticoagulant treatment:\nadministration of therapeutic doses of LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for more than 72 hours before randomization;\n3 or more doses of a vitamin K antagonist before randomization;\nthrombectomy, vena cava filter insertion, or thrombolysis used to manage the index episode;\n indication for anticoagulant treatment for a disease other than the index VTE episode;\nconcomitant use of strong inhibitors or inducers of both cytochrome P-450 3A4 and P-Glycoprotein ;\nrelated to bleeding risk:\nconcomitant thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) or aspirin over 165 mg daily or dual antiplatelet therapy;\nactive bleeding or high risk of bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant treatment\nrecent (in the last 1 month prior to randomization) brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery\n hemoglobin level lower than 8 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L) or platelet count <75x109/L or history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia;\ncreatinine clearance < 30 ml /min based on the Cockcroft Gault equation;\nacute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis; or an alanine aminotransferase level 3 times or more and/or bilirubin level 2 times or more higher the upper limit of the normal range;\nuncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP> 180 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment);\nstandard criteria:\n bacterial endocarditis;\nhypersensitivity to the study drugs or to any of their excipients;\npatients participation in other pharmaco therapeutic program with an experimental therapy that is known to effect the coagulation system.\nwomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who do not practice a medically accepted highly effective contraception during the trial and one month beyond. Highly effective contraception methods are:\na. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\nb. progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\nc. intrauterine device (IUD)\nd. intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\ne. bilateral tubal occlusion\nf. vasectomized partner\ng. sexual abstinence ;\npregnancy, or breast feeding\nany condition that, as judged by the investigator, would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study.\n"

The IDMC will be composed of independent\nmembers with relevant expertise. The committee will operate under a charter that defines its\nresponsibilities, which will include periodic review of accumulating data. The IDMC may recom\n‐\nmend modifications to the protocol or early termination of the study, as was the case in the\nAVERROES study, which was stopped early due to clear evidence of benefit with an acceptable\nsafety profile. An Early Safety Data Review Committee may also be implemented for safety\nsignal detection, with predefined stopping rules based on events such as deaths or specific\nSAEs.\n## 10.1.7 Dissemination of Clinical Study Data\nStudy participants will be provided the option of receiving their individual study data. Manage\n‐\nment of dissemination and the process for providing this option will be in accordance with\nsponsor policies, laws, and regulations.\n## 10.1.8 Data Quality Assurance\nAll participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRFs\nunless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data).

    "output": "## 1.1 Synopsis\n\nProtocol Title:\nA Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Apixaban to the Standard of Care (SOC) Dalte\n‐\nparin for the Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer.\nBrief Title:\nCARAVAGGIO study\nRegulatory Agency Identifier Number(s):\nRegistry\nID\n[Pediatric Investigational Plan Number]:\nObjectives, Endpoints, and Estimands:\nThe trial will be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of\ncare (SOC), dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH), for the treatment of acute\nvenous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The study will evaluate apixaban for\nnon-inferiority to dalteparin for the primary outcome of recurrent VTE. Patients with active cancer\ncan be at high risk of both venous thromboembolism and bleeding events, and those who devel\n‐\nop VTE are at greater risk for recurrent VTE and early death. When apixaban is considered for\nDVT or PE treatment in cancer patients, a careful assessment of the benefits against the risks\nshould be made, based on the patient’s individual risk for thrombosis and major bleeding after\nfull discussion of the potential benefits and harms. The rationale for this study is based on the\nhypothesis that apixaban may be an effective and safe option for the treatment of VTE in this\npopulation.\nObjectives\nEndpoints\nPrimary\n- To assess the non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcutaneous low\nmolecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly\ndiagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism\n(PE) in patients with cancer.\n-\nSecondary\n- To compare the rates of the composite of major and clinically relevant non-\nmajor (CRNM) bleeding, and all bleeding events between the apixaban and\ndalteparin groups.\n- To assess the incidence of major bleeding (MB) and clinically relevant non-\nmajor bleeding (CRNMB).\n- To evaluate rates of major bleeding in patient subgroups.\n- To compare the incidence of the Major Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)\nendpoint, a composite of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), non-fatal\npulmonary embolism (PE), and VTE-related death, between apixaban and\ndalteparin.\n- To evaluate the efficacy of apixaban versus dalteparin in patient subgroups\ndefined by cancer type and whether the VTE was incidental versus\nsymptomatic.\n- To evaluate the individual components of the primary efficacy outcome.\n- To evaluate symptomatic recurrence of VTE.\n- To evaluate all-cause death.\n- To evaluate the composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major\nbleeding.\n- To evaluate the composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus all-cause\ndeath.\n- To evaluate the composite of the primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding\nplus all-cause death.\n- To evaluate any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal, including acute\nmyocardial infarction or ischemic stroke.\n- To evaluate all venous thromboembolic events, including splanchnic vein\nthrombosis and cerebral vein thrombosis.\n- To evaluate permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety\nreasons.\n- To assess Quality of Life (QoL) according to the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale\n(ACTS).\n-\nObjectives\nEndpoints\n- To conduct analyses and report on patient subgroups defined by cancer type,\ncancer treatment, and incidental versus symptomatic VTE.\nOverall Design Synopsis:\nThis will be an international, multicenter, Phase IIIB/Phase 3, pivotal, interventional clinical study.\nThe design will incorporate a Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE) ap\n‐\nproach, where patients and investigators will be aware of treatment assignments, but outcome\nadjudication will be blinded. The study will also be a pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority,\nactive-controlled,  event-driven,  randomized  controlled  trial.  Masking  will  be  applied  to  the\nassessor for outcome adjudication, but not to the participant or investigator.\nBrief Summary:\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of\ncare (SOC), dalteparin, for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients\nwith cancer.\nStudy details will include:\n- The study duration for each participant will be up to 7 months.\n- The treatment duration will be 6 months.\n- The visit frequency will include a follow-up visit scheduled at 7 months from randomization.\n- Health measurements will include efficacy (recurrent VTE), safety (major bleeding, clinically\nrelevant non-major bleeding, all bleeding), and Quality of Life (QoL).\n- The participant population will include patients with cancer-associated VTE, including sympto\n‐\nmatic or incidentally diagnosed acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embol\n‐\nism (PE). Patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary or metastatic cerebral\ncancers, known brain metastases, and acute leukaemia will be excluded. Caution with direct\nfactor Xa inhibitors will be warranted in GI and genitourinary malignancies and other settings\nwith high risk for mucosal bleeding.\nNumber of Participants:\nA total of 1,170 patients with cancer and symptomatic or incidental acute proximal deep vein\nthrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) will be enrolled in the study.\nStudy Arms and Duration:\n-\nArm 1 (Apixaban):\nPatients will receive oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily (bid) for the first 7\ndays, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg bid for six months.\n-\nArm 2 (Dalteparin):\nPatients will receive subcutaneous (SC) dalteparin 200 IU/kg once daily\nfor the first month, followed by a maintenance dose of 150 IU/kg o.i.d. for the subsequent five\nmonths.\nThe total treatment duration for each participant will be 6 months.\nData Monitoring/Other Committee: [Yes/No]",

Thereafter, dalteparin will be administered at a dose of 150 IU/kg o.i.d. for 5 months (total period of treatment: six months). The maximum daily dose allowed for dalteparin is 18,000IU.\nApixaban 5mg will be supplied by the Promoter as film-coated tablets.\nDalteparin will be supplied by the Promoter as single-use pre-filled syringes.\nStudy Scheduled Patient’s Visits\nThe study should foresee the following scheduled visits: at enrollment, at 4 weeks, at 3 months, at 6 months, at the end of study treatment whenever it occurs, and at 7 months from randomization.\nAdditional visits will be performed if new symptoms and/or signs of VTE or major bleeding develop. A clinical examination and objective tests will be performed if the patient develops symptoms or signs suggestive of recurrent VTE.\nStudy Objectives \nPrimary efficacy outcome:\nobjectively confirmed recurrent VTE occurring during the study period, that means the composite of:\n• proximal DVT of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected)\n• DVT of the upper limb (symptomatic)\n• PE (symptomatic or unsuspected)\nSecondary efficacy outcomes:\n• the individual components of the primary efficacy outcome;\n• symptomatic recurrence of VTE;\n• all cause death;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus major bleeding plus all cause death;\n• the composite of primary efficacy outcome plus all cause death;\n• any major cardiovascular event, fatal or non-fatal (including acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke);\n• all venous thromboembolic events (including splanchnic vein thrombosis and cerebral vein thrombosis);\n• Quality of life (QoL) according to Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) \nSafety Study Outcomes:\nPrimary safety outcome is major bleeding, defined (as per ISTH guidelines), as acute clinically overt bleeding associated with one or more of the following:\n• decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dl (1.2 mmol/L) or more;\n• transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells;\n• bleeding that occurs in at least one critical site [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal];\n• bleeding that is fatal;\n• bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention\nSecondary safety outcomes include:\n• Clinically relevant non-major bleeding event defined as acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of:\n• any bleeding compromising hemodynamics;\n• spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, or 100 cm2 if there was a traumatic cause;\n• intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography;\n• epistaxis or gingival bleeding requiring tamponade or other medical intervention or bleeding from venipuncture for >5 minutes;\n• hematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures;\n• hemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention;\n• or any other bleeding considered to have clinical consequences for a patient such as medical intervention,\nthe need for unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, or temporary cessation of a study drug, or associated with pain or impairment of activities of daily life.\n• Clinically relevant bleeding defined as the composite of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding\n• Permanent early discontinuation of study drug due to safety reasons\nMaximum Sample Size for each arm\nLess than 600 patients for each treatment group\nRecommended Inclusion Criteria\nAge > 18 years\nBoth Genders\nSigned Informed Consent\nConsecutive patients with a newly diagnosed, objectively\nconfirmed:\n• symptomatic or unsuspected, proximal lower-limb DVT\nor\n• symptomatic PE or\n• unsuspected PE in a segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery.\nAny type of cancer (other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, primary brain tumor or known intracerebral metastases and acute leukemia) that meets at least one of the\nfollowing:\n• Active cancer defined as diagnosis of cancer within six months before the study inclusion, or receiving treatment for cancer at the time of inclusion or any treatment for cancer during 6 months prior to randomization, or recurrent locally advanced or metastatic cancer.\n• Cancer diagnosed within 2 years before the study inclusion (history of cancer).\nRecommended Exclusion Criteria\nage <18 years\nECOG Performance Status III or IV;\nlife expectancy of less than 6 months;\nrelated to anticoagulant treatment:\nadministration of therapeutic doses of LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for more than 72 hours before randomization;\n3 or more doses of a vitamin K antagonist before randomization;\nthrombectomy, vena cava filter insertion, or thrombolysis used to manage the index episode;\n indication for anticoagulant treatment for a disease other than the index VTE episode;\nconcomitant use of strong inhibitors or inducers of both cytochrome P-450 3A4 and P-Glycoprotein ;\nrelated to bleeding risk:\nconcomitant thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) or aspirin over 165 mg daily or dual antiplatelet therapy;\nactive bleeding or high risk of bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant treatment\nrecent (in the last 1 month prior to randomization) brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery\n hemoglobin level lower than 8 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L) or platelet count <75x109/L or history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia;\ncreatinine clearance < 30 ml /min based on the Cockcroft Gault equation;\nacute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis;

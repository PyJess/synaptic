    "prompt": "1.3. Schedule of Activities (SoA)\nThese are your instructions:General information:\nThese are your instructions:* Ensure that only essential data are collected. The schedule of activities (SoA) is the primary location for specifying the timing of assessments at each stage of the study. Do not repeat the SoA schedule in the main text.\nThese are your instructions:* Visit windows may be necessary for the data collection. The acceptable windows can be indicated on the SoA by adding  days or hours/minutes to the visit day or timepoint row. \nThese are your instructions:* If applicable, specify the order of assessments (eg, performing participant-recorded assessments before other assessments to reduce bias or performing electrocardiograms [ECG] or measuring vital signs before blood draws).\nThese are your instructions:* Notes/footnotes (relating to specific procedures) should be minimal, brief, and include key information. If additional details are needed, the notes should refer to the section in the protocol main text where details are provided. Note that Day 0 should not be used as a timepoint. \nThese are your instructions:* Combine assessments on consecutive weeks if they are identical and consider separate tables for separate periods of the study (eg, screening, intervention days, and follow-up). For a multiple-part study, one SoA table for each part of the study is recommended.\nThese are your instructions:* An example of a SoA table is included. Modify as required.\nThese are your instructions:* Protocol language in the SoA section should be kept general and should describe the location of procedures or visits in a non-specific way.  In order to facilitate the unanticipated use of a local laboratory/imaging, a home health care nurse, or a participant visit to a family doctor, it is recommended that location information is not specified in the SoA or footnote sections.  For instance, specifying the procedure location description in the SoA as On-site visit or On-site laboratory/ imaging, creates unnecessary protocol deviations if on-site visits cannot be conducted; Study teams are advised to adopt the template language of Visit or Procedure to ensure intentional flexibility.  \nThese are your instructions:* For complex trials, assessments that are specific to a sub-protocol should be outlined in a separate SoA in the applicable sub-protocol. Assessments common to all populations/interventions should remain in the master protocol.\nThese are your instructions:Procedure\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are

Participants may be asked to complete a survey, at one or more timepoints, to collect feedback on their experience with participation in the clinical trial. Individual participant level responses will be anonymous to the investigatorand site staff and so will not be reviewed by investigators. Coded responses would be used by the sponsorto understand where improvements can be made in the clinical trial process.We may combine responsesacross studies and with data collected as part of the study, such as demographics, to investigatecorrelations with the participant experience. We may share aggregated data, maintaining individualsanonymity, with site staff so they can take steps to understand and improve the participant experience attheir site.This questionnaire does not collect data about the participants disease, symptoms, treatment effector adverse events and therefore would not be trial data. Consequently, this data does not contribute to anyendpoints on the study and will be analyzed and reported separately from the clinical study data. Theresults of this participant experience analysis may be published or presented at scientific meetings, with theSponsor complying with the requirements for publication.

    "output": "## 4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design\n\nThe trial will be designed to compare the efficacy and safety of apixaban with the standard of\ncare (SOC), dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin, LMWH), for the treatment of acute\nvenous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The primary objective will be to assess\nthe non-inferiority of oral apixaban compared to subcutaneous dalteparin for treating newly\ndiagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in this patient\npopulation. The study is designed to test if apixaban meets pre-specified non-inferiority criteria.\nApixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa,\nwhich does not require antithrombin III for its antithrombotic activity. It inhibits both free and clot-\nbound factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity. While apixaban has no direct effects on\nplatelet aggregation, it indirectly inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. By inhibiting\nfactor Xa, apixaban is hypothesized to prevent thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus\ndevelopment.\nThe ASH guideline panel suggests a DOAC (apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) over LMWH\nfor the short-term treatment (3-6 months) of VTE for patients with active cancer (conditional\nrecommendation, low certainty in the evidence of effects). The choice of treatment must be\nbased on the specific clinical setting to minimize risk, after careful consideration of potential\ndrug-drug interactions, bleeding risk, patient preference, and the availability of treatment options,\nincluding cost.\n## 4.2.1 Patient Input into Design\nThis trial will include an option for patients to complete a voluntary ‘Study Participant Feedback\nQuestionnaire’.  The  purpose  will  be  to  collect  feedback  on  their  clinical  trial  experience.\nIndividual participant responses will be anonymous to the investigator and site staff. Coded,\naggregated responses will be used by the sponsor to understand where improvements can be\nmade in the clinical trial process. This questionnaire will not collect data about the participant’s\ndisease, symptoms, treatment effect, or adverse events and will be analyzed and reported\nseparately from the clinical study data.",

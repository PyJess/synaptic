    "prompt": "3. Objectives, Endpoints, and Estimands\nThese are your instructions:The protocol is the primary source of information for protocol endpoint registration on public registers (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov).\nThese are your instructions:Objectives:\nThese are your instructions:* Objectives and endpoints for specific therapeutic areas may be accessed in the therapeutic area libraries. List each scientific objective of the study, clearly and concisely, differentiating between primary, secondary, and tertiary (or other/exploratory) objectives. The objectives should present the questions that the study is designed to answer (which can include predefined safety parameters). Secondary objectives should not merely reiterate the secondary endpoints of the study.\nThese are your instructions:* State specific PRO objectives. Specify the PRO concepts/domains used to evaluate the intervention (eg, overall health-related quality of life, specific domain, specific symptom) and, for each one, the analysis metric (eg, change from baseline, final value, time to event) and the principal timepoint or period of interest.\nThese are your instructions:* The objectives should be stated with sufficient specificity that the reader can easily understand the intended context (eg, Superiority of [intervention X] vs control when the intervention is taken as directed). Consultation or review by a statistician is recommended.\nThese are your instructions:Endpoints:\nThese are your instructions:* An endpoint is defined in draft ICH E8(R1) as a subject-level attribute of interest, so ensure wordings like proportion of participants reaching [target] are not used, but rather Participant reaching [target] (yes/no) when defining endpoints.\nThese are your instructions:* Ensure that there is an endpoint with associated timepoint or timeframe for each study objective including exploratory objectives, if applicable, and that there are no endpoints without a corresponding objective.\nThese are your instructions:* Be specific and selective when choosing and describing primary and secondary endpoints because results for all primary and secondary endpoints are required to be listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website and other public registers. \nThese are your instructions:* In a study designed to establish efficacy, a primary endpoint should measure a clinically meaningful therapeutic effect or be a surrogate or other endpoint with a demonstrated ability to predict clinical benefit.\nThese are your instructions:* Avoid vague descriptions of primary and secondary endpoints that encapsulate a large number of measures and timepoints, such as safety and tolerability as determined by AE reporting, laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs. In a typical clinical study this could equate to hundreds of endpoints, all of which must be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and other public registers. Consider including such general objectives and endpoints in the Tertiary/Exploratory/Other section, which will not be registered on public registers.\nThese are your instructions:* If there is a safety measure of special relevance, this can be included as a specific primary or secondary endpoint (eg, a specific lab measurement or an adverse event of special interest).\nThese are your instructions:* It is recommended not to include study procedures as an endpoint; only the data resulting from the procedure should be an endpoint. For example, abnormal physical examination should not be designated as an endpoint unless it is clear where this endpoint is captured and how it will be summarized in the clinical study report. Details of procedures should be placed in Section 8 Study Assessments and Procedures. Consider whether the desired endpoints will be achievable in case of unexpected findings, technical/equipment issues, or personnel failure.\nThese are your instructions:* If a clinical outcome assessment (COA) is included in the study, mention the concept being measured (eg, fatigue) as well as the instrument (eg, fatigue as measured by the fatigue scale in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia [FACT-An]). Avoid the term quality of life and use a more specific term such as physical functioning or vitality.\nThese are your instructions:* If additional tertiary/exploratory/other endpoints (eg, pharmacodynamic endpoints) may be explored, consider addition of a general statement giving an indication of the types of endpoints that might be explored. For example, in cardiovascular studies, a statement such as Additional atherosclerotic biomarkers may be explored may be appropriate. The study procedures section of the protocol should clarify, to the extent possible, how and when the additional endpoints will be selected, the types of endpoints that may be assayed (eg, protein, messenger ribonucleic acid), whether existing or additional samples would be used for these assays, and how any changes to exploratory endpoints will be documented.\nThese are your instructions:* Identify surrogate markers if used as study endpoints.\nThese are your instructions:Estimands:\nThese are your instructions:* It is recommended that objectives and endpoints be presented together in a table (see example) to ensure all endpoints are aligned with an objective. Further, it is recommended to include the definition(s) of the estimands below the table. \nThese are your instructions:* Estimands include 5 attributes: the treatment condition of interest, the population, variable (or endpoint), details of how to account for intercurrent events (ICEs), and the population-level summary for the variable.\nThese are your instructions:* The ICH E9(R1) addendum tries to distinguish the development of the estimand, ie, the treatment effect of interest, and the conduct of a study for estimation. While in practice the estimand is defined in order to plan a study, ideally it should be possible to communicate the estimand without reference to study specific context. For example, the population should reflect the set of patients or individuals targeted by the clinical question, represented by the study population. Describing the population, the appropriate term patients or individuals should be used instead of referring to study participants. The same is true for the treatment conditions: the test intervention and the control to which comparison(s) will be made should be mentioned, giving the name of the specific intervention, but not simply referring to study intervention.\nThese are your instructions:* The estimands should be clear and include sufficient detail on each attribute. \nThese are your instructions:* Estimands are mandatory for confirmatory studies (ie, studies in which pre-specified hypotheses are evaluated, see ICH E9), but it is also strongly recommended to include estimands in other types of studies.\nThese are your instructions:* Define one or more estimands for the primary and key secondary objectives. An estimand description is not required for tertiary/exploratory objectives. \nThese are your instructions:* Include the clinical question(s) of interest that drives the estimand(s) and provide a rationale for the chosen estimand(s), eg, per regulatory guidance or per clinical justification such as estimating the treatment effect without the confounding effect of rescue intervention or the treatment effect including the effect of rescue medication to reflect clinical practice. Make sure to address all ICEs and all other attributes of the estimand and justify accordingly.\nThese are your instructions:* If including more than one estimand for the primary objective, one of them should be named primary. \nThese are your instructions:* If for a particular study different primary estimands/endpoints are required for different regulatory authorities, it should be specified which one is considered primary for each regulatory authority.\nThese are your instructions:* Indicate not applicable or remove the section if no estimand is defined for the study.\nThese are your instructions:For complex trials, the master protocol should have an overarching scientific hypothesis and the primary objective should not be changed during the conduct of the trial.\nThese are your instructions:<Start of suggested text>\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:Objectives\nThese are your instructions:Endpoints\nThese are your instructions:Primary\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:* \nThese are your instructions:* \nThese are your instructions:Secondary\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:* \nThese are your instructions:* \nThese are your instructions:[Tertiary/Exploratory/Other]\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:* \nThese are your instructions:* \nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:<End of suggested text>\nThese are your instructions:Estimand(s) for Primary Objective(s)\nThese are your instructions:[Primary estimand / coprimary estimands / Multiple primary estimands]\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:The primary clinical question of interest is: \nThese are your instructions:What is the [population-level summary] in [endpoint] in [patients with [condition/disease]/individuals] treated with intervention X vs. intervention Y regardless of discontinuation of investigational intervention for any reason and regardless of initiation of rescue medication or change in background medication (dose and product)?\nThese are your instructions:The estimand is described by the following attributes:\nThese are your instructions:* Population: \nThese are your instructions:[patients with [condition/disease]/individuals]\nThese are your instructions:* Endpoint: \nThese are your instructions:change from baseline to [timepoint] in [health measurement/outcome]\nThese are your instructions:* Treatment condition: \nThese are your instructions:the investigational interventions regardless of discontinuation for any reason, with or without rescue medication or change in background medication (treatment policy strategy). \nThese are your instructions:* Remaining intercurrent events:\nThese are your instructions:The intercurrent events intervention discontinuation for any reason and initiation of rescue medication or change in background medication (dose and product) are addressed by the treatment condition of interest attribute.

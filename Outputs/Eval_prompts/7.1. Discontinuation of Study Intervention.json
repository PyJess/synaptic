    "output": "## 7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention\n\nIn rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study inter\n‐\nvention.  If  study  intervention  is  permanently  discontinued,  the  participant  should,  if  at  all\npossible, remain in the study to be evaluated for study outcomes. See the SoA for data to be\ncollected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up and for any further\nevaluations that need to be completed.\nAdministration  of  the  investigational  product  will  be  discontinued  if  a  severe  haemorrhage\noccurs, or prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures that carry a risk of bleeding. Apixaban\nshould be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a\nmoderate or high risk of bleeding, and at least 24 hours prior for those with a low risk of\nbleeding. Apixaban should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as\nsoon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been es\n‐\ntablished. Permanent early discontinuation of the study drug due to safety reasons will be a\nsecondary safety outcome.\n## 7.1.1 Liver Event Stopping Criteria\nDiscontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver tests will be required by the investigator\nwhen a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the protocol-specified algorithm or in\nthe presence of abnormal liver chemistries not meeting protocol-specified stopping rules if the\ninvestigator believes that it is in best interest of the participant.\n## 7.1.2 QTc Stopping Criteria\nIf a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to, changes from baseline\nin QT interval corrected using Bazett’s formula [QTcB] or Fridericia’s formula [QTcF]) after\nenrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue on\nthe study intervention and if any change in participant management is needed. This review of\nthe ECG printed at the time of collection must be documented. Any new clinically relevant finding\nshould be reported as an AE.\n## 7.1.3 Temporary Discontinuation\nTemporary cessation of the study drug may be required for certain bleeding events considered\nto have clinical consequences. Lapses in therapy should be avoided as discontinuing anticoagu\n‐\nlants places patients at an increased risk of thrombosis. If anticoagulation with apixaban must be\ntemporarily discontinued for any reason, therapy should be restarted as soon as possible.\n## 7.1.4 Rechallenge\nThis section will describe the procedures for restarting the intervention after stopping criteria\nhave been met.\n## 7.1.4.1 Study Intervention Restart or Rechallenge After Liver Stopping Criteria Are\n## Met\nStudy intervention restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met will be\nallowed in this study.

or an alanine aminotransferase level 3 times or more and/or bilirubin level 2 times or more higher the upper limit of the normal range;\nuncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP> 180 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment);\nstandard criteria:\n bacterial endocarditis;\nhypersensitivity to the study drugs or to any of their excipients;\npatients participation in other pharmaco therapeutic program with an experimental therapy that is known to effect the coagulation system.\nwomen of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who do not practice a medically accepted highly effective contraception during the trial and one month beyond. Highly effective contraception methods are:\na. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\nb. progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation\nc. intrauterine device (IUD)\nd. intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)\ne. bilateral tubal occlusion\nf. vasectomized partner\ng. sexual abstinence ;\npregnancy, or breast feeding\nany condition that, as judged by the investigator, would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study.\n"

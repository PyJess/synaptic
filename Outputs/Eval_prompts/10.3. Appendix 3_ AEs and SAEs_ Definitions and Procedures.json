A\nreasonable possibility\nof a relationship will suggest a causal link. The investigator will consult the IB and/or product\ninformation. This assessment will be crucial for regulatory reporting.\n## 10.3.3.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs\nThe investigator will be obligated to perform supplemental evaluations as medically\nindicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.

    "output": "## 9.3 Analyses Supporting Primary Objective(s)\n\n## 9.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)/Estimand(s)\n## 9.3.1.1 Definition of endpoint(s)\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint:\nThe primary efficacy outcome will be the incidence of the first event of the composite of\nobjectively confirmed recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) or VTE-related death occurring\nduring the study period. This composite endpoint will include:\n- Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs (symptomatic or unsuspected).\n- Symptomatic DVT of the upper limb.\n- Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (symptomatic or unsuspected).\n- VTE-related death.\nPrimary Safety Endpoint:\nThe primary safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding, as defined by the Interna\n‐\ntional Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidelines. A major bleeding event will be\nan acute, clinically overt bleeding event associated with one or more of the following:\n- A decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (1.2 mmol/L) or more.\n- Transfusion of two or more units of packed red blood cells.\n- Bleeding that occurs in a critical site (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-\narticular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal).\n- Bleeding that is fatal.\n- Bleeding that necessitates acute surgical intervention.\n## 9.3.1.2 Main Analytical Approach\nThe trial will be designed to test for non-inferiority. The primary statistical analysis for the efficacy\nendpoint, which is the time to the first event of the composite of recurrent VTE, will be a time-to-\nevent analysis. A 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the hazard ratio will be calculated to assess\nnon-inferiority. This approach is supported by findings from similar trials in related indications.\n## 9.3.1.3 Sensitivity Analyses\nSensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary endpoint results\nunder different assumptions and analytical approaches.\n## 9.3.1.4 Supplementary Analyses\nAdditional supplementary analyses may be performed to further support the primary objectives.",

    "output": "## 2.2 Background\n\nThe study will enroll patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). Approxim\n‐\nately 5% to 20% of patients with cancer develop a VTE, and approximately 20% of all VTE\ncases occur in patients with cancer. Patients with active cancer can be at high risk of both\nvenous thromboembolism and bleeding events. Sites of cancer with the highest rates of VTE\ninclude the pancreas, kidney, ovary, lung, and stomach. When apixaban is considered for DVT\nor PE treatment in cancer patients, a careful assessment of the benefits against the risks should\nbe made. It should be noted that patients with basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, primary\nor metastatic cerebral cancers, known brain metastases, and acute leukaemia will be excluded\nfrom this study.\nApixaban is a potent, oral, reversible, direct, and highly selective active site inhibitor of factor Xa.\nIts antithrombotic activity does not require antithrombin III. Apixaban functions by inhibiting both\nfree and clot-bound factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity. Through the inhibition of factor\nXa, apixaban prevents thrombin generation and subsequent thrombus development.\nPrevious clinical trials have evaluated apixaban against dalteparin for the treatment of VTE in\npatients with cancer. The direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are\nthe only DOACs that were evaluated for the short-term treatment of VTE for patients with\ncancer, and different DOACs have different drug-drug interactions.",

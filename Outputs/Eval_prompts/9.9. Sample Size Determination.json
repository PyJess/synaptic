Is life threatening\nThese are your instructions:The term life threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.\nThese are your instructions:c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\nThese are your instructions:* In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physicians office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.\nThese are your instructions:* Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.\nThese are your instructions:d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity\nThese are your instructions:* The term disability means a substantial disruption of a persons ability to conduct normal life functions.\nThese are your instructions:* This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.\nThese are your instructions:e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect\nThese are your instructions:f. [Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via an authorized medicinal product]\nThese are your instructions:g. Other situations:\nThese are your instructions:* Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.\nThese are your instructions:o Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions not resulting in hospitalization, or development of intervention dependency or intervention abuse.\nThese are your instructions:Add other SAEs relevant per protocol/study intervention. Obtain agreement with the pharmacovigilance group on any protocol or project-specific SAEs. Such SAEs should be specified in the other situations part of the SAE definition.\nThese are your instructions:Examples include:\nThese are your instructions:* Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities\nThese are your instructions:* [specify event]  see Section [X] for definition\nThese are your instructions:* [specify event] leading to permanent discontinuation of study intervention\nThese are your instructions:10.3.3.

The randomised\ncohort is planned to include approximately 671 patients. The sample size calculation will be\nbased on the primary efficacy estimand and will provide sufficient statistical power to test the\nprimary hypothesis at a prespecified type-1 error level, using a normal approximation method for\na 2-sided test. Assumptions for the calculation, including those related to intercurrent events and\nexpected event rates informed by previous large-scale trials, will be detailed.\nFor context, similar large-scale trials such as the AMPLIFY study randomized 5,395 patients.\n# Supporting Documentation and Operational\n# Considerations",

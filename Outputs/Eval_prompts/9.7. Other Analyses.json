    "prompt": "9.7. Other Analyses\nThese are your instructions:A description can be omitted from the protocol section and a reference made to the SAP. Alternatively, a high-level description can be provided and further detailed in the SAP, if not fully detailed in the study protocol.\nThese are your instructions:Analysis of other variables and/or parameters and subgroup analyses belong to this section.\nThese are your instructions:9.7.1. Other variables and/or parameters \nThese are your instructions:Other analyses may include analyses of assessments or derived parameters, which are not defined as endpoints but need to be prespecified in either the protocol or SAP. Examples include but are not limited to immunogenicity, biomarkers, PK/PD/population PK parameters, health care utilization variables, and health technology assessment-related variables. State if these will be reported in a separate document. \nThese are your instructions:Subsections may be used for different topics.\nThese are your instructions:It is recommended that the variables used in the analyses should be clearly defined and the analyses should be described at the same level of detail as the supportive secondary endpoint(s)/estimand(s).\nThese are your instructions:The definition and derivation may be specified in a table format.\nThese are your instructions:Specify estimands if applicable and not defined in Section 3.\nThese are your instructions:9.7.2. Subgroup analyses \nThese are your instructions:Note: Often individual standard clinical studies (excluding large outcomes or safety studies) are not designed to allow for statistically meaningful subgroup analyses because of too small sample sizes. Also, subgroup analyses are not commonly included in the set of multiplicity-controlled analyses and are therefore subject to multiplicity issues.\nThese are your instructions:It is recommended to consider addressing the following topics, if applicable:\nThese are your instructions:* Define the endpoints subject to subgroup analysis  can be for either efficacy and safety, or both.\nThese are your instructions:* Define subgroups (may include stratification factor, if relevant). Specify how participants will be classified into a subgroup in case of missing information.\nThese are your instructions:* Provide the purpose (consistency, hypothesis) of each subgroup analysis. The subgroup analyses should preferably be further substantiated, eg, biological plausibility of anticipated differential effect, regulatory/payer requirement.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify any rules to define the minimum size of a subgroup in order to carry out the analysis.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify analysis sets/estimand(s), as applicable.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify the subgroup analysis methods including how missing data are handled.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify the level of significance for the test of the investigational intervention/treatment condition-by-subgroup interaction, if applicable.\nThese are your instructions:* Assess consistency across regions and subpopulation(s) for multiregional clinical studies, as specified in ICH E17.\nThese are your instructions:* Describe how results will be presented. It is recommended to focus on estimates and confidence intervals rather than p-values. It is often useful to display the results in a forest plot.\nThese are your instructions:\nThese are your instructions:9.8. Interim [Analysis/Analyses]\nThese are your instructions:If an interim analysis is planned, describe if any type of data monitoring committee will be established to evaluate the interim analyses (the safety data and/or the critical efficacy endpoints) in accordance with ICH E9. Also describe the role of the committee (eg, making recommendation to the sponsor whether to continue, modify, or stop a study). Full details of the committee including any charters should be included in Appendix 10.1.5 Committees Structure.\nThese are your instructions:The following information belongs in this section:\nThese are your instructions:* Reason for conducting interim analyses and the impact on the conduct of the study\nThese are your instructions:* Endpoints to be included in the interim analyses\nThese are your instructions:* Timing of the interim analyses (eg, number of participants enrolled, number of participants completing a certain number of visits, number of events, calendar time)\nThese are your instructions:* Any actions resulting from an interim analysis such as sample size re-estimation or stopping rules\nThese are your instructions:* Multiplicity considerations relating to the interim and final analyses\nThese are your instructions:* Blinding/ unblinding strategy\nThese are your instructions:<Start of example text>\nThese are your instructions:An interim analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed by the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), consisting of [X] clinicians and 1 statistician who are independent experts not otherwise involved in the study when approximately [X] primary events have occurred. The analysis method for the primary efficacy endpoint described in Section 9.3.2 Primary Endpoints/Estimands will be used for the interim analysis. Based on the group sequential design with the [OBrien Fleming] alpha spending approach, a 2-sided alpha of [X] will be allocated to the interim analysis. In addition, if the conditional power for the final analysis (based on the original assumption for the remaining study) is [X] or lower, the study may be stopped for futility.\nThese are your instructions:The interim analysis will be conducted such that the ongoing study integrity is maintained. Only the independent statistical support group, who is responsible for providing the interim analysis results to the IDMC will be unblinded to the individual treatment group assignments. Interim analysis results will not be shared with investigators, participants, or the study team who are involved in the conduct of the study before the final database lock. \nThese are your instructions:The statistical analysis plan will describe the planned interim analyses in greater detail.\nThese are your instructions:<End of example text>MANDATORY SPONSOR INPUTS FOR STUDY PROTOCOL GENERATION\nSponsor Name FADOI /BMS/PFIZER\nStudy Acronym (if available):  CARAVAGGIO Study\nTested IMP :Apixaban\nComparative drug: Dalteparin\nStudy Type Interventional\nSe Study Type = Interventional:\nInterventional Study Phase Phase IIIb\nStudy Design International, multicenter, Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE), where both patients and investigators are aware of the treatment assignments, but the outcome assessment is blindedactive-controlled, event-driven, Phase IIIB clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of Apixaban to the SOC Dalteparin in for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess whether oral apixaban is non-inferior to the subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMWH) dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer.\nTarget Disease: VTE (DVT/PE) in cancer patients\nType of Randomization: Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis (permuted blocks of four) to receive either apixaban or dalteparin in an open-label fashion.\nRandomization should be centralized and stratified by:\n1) symptomatic vs. unsuspected VTE\n2) active cancer vs. history of cancer\nTested drugs and dosages \nApixaban group: orally administered, at the dose of 10 mg bid for 7 days, followed by 5 mg bid (total period of treatment: six months)\nDalteparin group: subcutaneously administered, at a dose of 200 IU/kg SC o.i.d for 1 month.

If PK will not be part of the study, include a statement to this effect. \nThese are your instructions:* Describe any study intervention concentrations to be measured and the sample collection times relative to dosing. Samples of plasma, urine, or other fluids may be taken for the purpose of measuring compliance, adjusting dose, or determining if a therapeutic window exists. This section of the protocol will be written in collaboration with the appropriate PK representatives and will contain information about sampling times, sample volume, sample handling procedures, assay methods, etc. Specific sample collection and processing including retention time instructions can be described in an appendix and cross-referenced.\nThese are your instructions:* Indicate definitions for the PK parameters (eg, area under the curve [AUC], maximum observed concentration [Cmax], time to Cmax [Tmax], half-life [T], volume of distribution [Vd], clearance [CL]) of interest and how they will be calculated. Consult with the PK representative for this information.\nThese are your instructions:* Describe sampling time relative to ingestion of food, posture, and possible effects of concomitant medications/alcohol/caffeine/nicotine.\nThese are your instructions:* Describe the biological sample(s) collected (blood, urine, or other such as breath, saliva, biopsies, etc), the handling of samples, and the assay method including references to published and/or internal assay validation documentation.\nThese are your instructions:* Specify other factors that are important in assessing the PK of the study intervention (eg, soluble circulating receptors, renal or hepatic function) and the plan for measuring these factors.\nThese are your instructions:* Do not reiterate the details given in the SoA or other sections of the protocol. Use cross-references as needed.\nThese are your instructions:* If samples remaining after the pharmacokinetic analysis may be used for future exploratory research, describe here or include a separate section for future research and cross-reference.

    "faithfulness-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the actual output and the retrieval context, indicating a perfect alignment.",

    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.2,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.20 because the actual output contains numerous irrelevant statements about medical device studies, which do not pertain to the specific requirements of a drug trial for Apixaban and Dalteparin as mentioned in the input. This misalignment significantly diminishes the relevancy, preventing a higher score. However, the score reflects some level of relevance due to the presence of segments that marginally touch upon the concepts of study protocols, although in the wrong context."

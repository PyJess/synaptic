    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.8947368421052632,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.89 because most parts of the response are appropriately aligned with the input's instructions, demonstrating a good understanding of general methods and definitions in a clinical study protocol. However, the mention of the AMPLIFY study and the emphasis on managing the family-wise error rate introduces elements that are not directly relevant to the core requirements of the input, preventing the score from being higher."

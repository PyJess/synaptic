    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.8,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.80 because most of the output aligns well with the secondary objectives specified in the input, providing detailed descriptions and relevant considerations. However, the repeated mentions of subgroup analyses, which do not directly address the specified secondary objectives, prevent the score from being higher. Despite these few irrelevant statements, the remainder of the output closely follows the input instructions, maintaining a high degree of relevance."

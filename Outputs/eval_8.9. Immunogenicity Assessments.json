    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.86 because, despite an overall strong alignment of the content with the input regarding immunogenicity assessments, a specific statement deviated by focusing on procedural data collection instead of the core topic. This minor distraction slightly detracted from a higher score. However, the majority of the output maintained relevance, effectively addressing the main aspects needed."

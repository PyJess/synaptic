    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.89 because the majority of the output offers relevant and well-organized information about the study's interventions, design, and objectives. The details align closely with the input instructions, showing a deep understanding of the project's structure and aims. However, the mention of GI cancer risks is slightly off-topic to the primary focus of the study design and participant protocol shared in the input, thus preventing a perfect score."

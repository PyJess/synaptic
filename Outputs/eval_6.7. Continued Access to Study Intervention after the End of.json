    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.80 because the response largely aligns with the key input instructions by including elements such as planned extension studies and participant-level access. However, the inclusion of costs and patient preferences, which weren't part of the input requirements, prevented a higher score."

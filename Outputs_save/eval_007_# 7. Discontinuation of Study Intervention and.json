    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.71 because, while most of the output focused on clinical trial protocol specifics, much of the content diverted into details unrelated to intervention discontinuation, such as ECG findings reporting and untested sample destruction procedures. However, the score remains relatively high, as core aspects of the input were addressed in the relevant sections, reflecting a good understanding of the study's scope."

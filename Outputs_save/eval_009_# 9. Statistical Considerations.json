    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.87 because the main content aligns well with the requested 'Statistical Considerations' section, providing necessary insights related to protocol design, randomization, drug administration, and safety outcomes. However, certain details, primarily about participant exclusion criteria and unrelated aspects like financial disclosure, slightly reduce the score as they deviate from the primary focus on statistical considerations."

    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-score": 0.4583333333333333,
    "answer_relevancy-DeepEval-reason": "The score is 0.46 because while the generated content includes several accurate details about the study's design and structure, it also contains a significant number of irrelevant statements. These extraneous details detract from the focus on the core requirements of the study design, such as the inclusion of patient numbers, treatment period specifics, and other non-essential elements that are not directly tied to the designated task of the study design section. Despite these extraneous details, the understanding of core elements regarding the study type, randomization, and drug administration shows a moderate alignment with the input requirements."
